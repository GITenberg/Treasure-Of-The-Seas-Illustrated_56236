       style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE waters of the Atlantic Ocean were
      reddened far and wide by the rays of the rising sun. The glorious beams
      had flashed over tract after tract of the watery expanse as they came from
      the east, until at length they poured in a full blaze upon a certain gay
      and gallant bark which lay tossing upon the tide somewhere within a
      hundred miles or so of the shore of the western world. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet though undeniably gay and gallant, the hand of time was visible on
      that bounding bark. For her buoyant hull was worn, and torn, and aged, and
      weather-beaten, and in fact decrepit. Aloft, over that battered hull,
      whose dilapidated sides, covered with bruises and bare of paint, showed
      gaping seams, from which the oakum protruded, rose the rickety masts and
      rotten old rigging. The sails, all torn, and worn, and rent, and patched,
      were spread to catch the breeze, while on high floated a gallant but dingy
      flag, bearing the blazonry of a now undecipherable emblem, together with
      letters now half effaced, which looked like &ldquo;B. O. W. C.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such a disreputable craft, and such preposterous sails, had surely never
      before met the eye of the astonished sun in these waters, and great must
      have been the hardihood, or else the ignorance, of those who dared commit
      themselves and her to the merciless ocean. Whether bold or ignorant,
      however, there they were, all of them&mdash;Captain Corbet, the mate,
      Solomon, and the boys of the &ldquo;B. O. W. C.;&rdquo; and these now all stood on the
      deck of the Antelope, looking at the reddening dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the helm of his gallant bark stood her bold commander, as wise, as
      vigilant, and as care-worn as ever, shading his venerable brow with his
      hand, while, with eagle eye, he sought to make out some floating object or
      some friendly shore. But to that eagle eye the wide waste of waters showed
      nothing of the kind; and so it came to pass that, at length, the aged
      Corbet heaved a gentle sigh, and his eyes rested with mournful meaning
      upon his young companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, captain,&rdquo; said Bart, who was standing near him, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t seem to
      have made land yet&mdash;do we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain shook his head slowly and solemnly. &ldquo;Kine o&rsquo; curous, too,&rdquo; he
      ejaculated, after a thoughtful pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you have any more idea of where we are than you had
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, &ldquo;not to say much of an idea; but I&rsquo;m kine o&rsquo;
      comin round, an mebbe I&rsquo;ll get the hang of it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why not head her west? We&rsquo;ll be sure to come in sight of land
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the captain shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;about that. Thar&rsquo;s currents, an thar&rsquo;s
      eddies; an thar&rsquo;s the Gulf Stream to be considered. Now, if we&rsquo;d kep
      straight on at fust, when we got out o&rsquo; Canso, we&rsquo;d been all right; or
      even after we left Louisbourg, ef we&rsquo;d only kep along the coast, in sight&mdash;but
      thar&rsquo;s the mischief of it. I let her git out o&rsquo; sight o&rsquo; land that night,
      an she got kine o&rsquo; slewed round, and &rsquo;s kep kine o&rsquo; cantin round
      every which way, until at last she&rsquo;s in this here onfort&rsquo;nit position. An
      now I&rsquo;m all teetotally aderrift!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I shouldn&rsquo;t think that we can be more than a hundred miles or so
      south-east of the Nova Scotia coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I don&rsquo;t know; seems to me we may jest as well be off Bermudy as
      anywhars else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bermuda!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, in amazement. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I don&rsquo;t see why not. Here we air, after a kerrewsin around a whole
      fortnight every which way, driven up an down by wind an tide, an canterin
      along with the Gulf Stream; an whenever, we ventured to hail a passin
      vessel, only gettin the finger o&rsquo; scorn a pinted at us for our pains, an
      the laughter of frivolous an light-minded men. So what&rsquo;s to hender us from
      bein anywhars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think it would be better to take some one
      course, and stick to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I done it?&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I done it every day? Every day
      I took some definite course, and stuck to it; an what&rsquo;s the result? Young
      sir, if you seek a answer, look around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But something must be done,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;or else we&rsquo;ll find the Antelope
      becoming a second edition of the Flying Dutchman. A fortnight of this sort
      of thing&rsquo;s no joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who ever said it was?&rdquo; said Captain Corbet. &ldquo;An what&rsquo;s wuss, every passin
      vessel will pussist in makin it a joke. They think we&rsquo;re a fishin
      schooner, bound to the banks; an if we ask a honest question, they won&rsquo;t
      do anything but yell out jokes that ain&rsquo;t got any pint that ever I can
      see. Wal, this sarves me right, for ever ventrin outside of old Fundy. Put
      me in old Fundy an I&rsquo;m all right; out here I ain&rsquo;t any good, an hadn&rsquo;t
      ought ever to dreamt of comin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From this it will be seen that the ill-fated Antelope was once more in a
      most unpleasant predicament, and the company on board appeared in danger
      of encountering adventures of as unpleasant a kind as they had known in
      the Gulf of St. Lawrence, if not worse. And certainly the prospect was
      dark indeed, when the captain himself could go so far as to hint at
      Bermuda as being by any possibility in their neighborhood. So Bart
      thought; and as he walked away there was a shade of anxiety on his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked forward he saw Solomon drawing some water for breakfast out
      of one of the barrels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon,&rdquo; asked Bart, &ldquo;how are we off for provisions this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sable functionary raised his aged form, and, holding the water-pail in
      one hand, with the other he slowly scratched his venerable wool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Masr Bart,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;dis yar time we ain&rsquo;t got no &rsquo;tiklar
      cause for &rsquo;ziety. Dar&rsquo;s a barl of salt pork, an two barls of
      biscuit, an dat ar&rsquo;s &rsquo;ficient for de &rsquo;quirements of dis yar
      company. Lucky for us, too, dat Cap&rsquo;n Fuggeson cars for us. He put this
      pork an biscuit aboard for extry, an say dat we all boun to come to
      roonatium some how. An dat ar am de very &rsquo;visiums dat we got to lib
      on now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t we got anything better than salt pork and biscuit left?&rdquo;
       asked Bart, in a rueful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, notin &rsquo;tiklar. Dar&rsquo;s a drawin or two ob tea&mdash;an a grain
      or two ob flour&mdash;an some red her&rsquo;n; but, law sakes! child alive&mdash;what
      you mean by frettin and pinin so long&rsquo;s dar&rsquo;s lot to eat? Neb-ber you
      mind. I&rsquo;ll cook up dis yar pork so &rsquo;s you&rsquo;ll blieve it&rsquo;s roast
      turkey. Will so. You don&rsquo;t know me yet. Tell you what,&mdash;wait till you
      see how I cook up dis yar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I know,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;I believe you could feed us on saw-dust soup, if
      you hadn&rsquo;t anything else. It wasn&rsquo;t that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw-dust soup!&rdquo; cried Solomon. His eyes rolled fearfully. His aged figure
      bent double. He put the pail of water down, and then seated himself on the
      deck, where he proceeded to shake his venerable sides, and swing his body
      backward and forward, while chuckles, and giggles, and choking laughter
      burst from him. Every little while, as he could get his breath, he would
      roll up the whites of his eyes with a look of ecstasy, and whisper to
      himself, &ldquo;Saw-dust soup!&mdash;saw-dust soup!&mdash;dat&rsquo;s so. Tell you
      what! takes ole Solomon to do it. He&rsquo;s de boy. Is so! Yah, yah, yah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From this outburst of African sentiment Bart turned mournfully away, and
      stood apart, looking pensively upon the water. The other boys seemed to
      feel as he did, for they all had on their faces an expression of anxiety
      and disappointment. They all knew how they were situated, and the
      situation was not agreeable to any one of them. Whatever novelty there may
      have been in it had gone off long ago, and there was nothing now left but
      impatience and vexation of spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind had been freshening during the night; and now, as the day
      advanced, it grew more and more boisterous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s blowin a leetle mite too fresh,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet to Bruce, &ldquo;for
      to contennew on this course; so I&rsquo;ll jest come round, an run afore it.
      Arter all, it&rsquo;s the best course,&mdash;for it&rsquo;s west, an had ought to
      fetch us up somewhar eventooly, though I ain&rsquo;t got overly much confidence
      in this here compass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Compass! Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with the compass?&rdquo; asked Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, yesterday at sunrise,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, in a gentle tone of
      regret, &ldquo;I noticed that, accordin to the compass, the sun was a risin in
      the nothe, an that was agin natur. So I knowed that either the sun was
      wrong or the compass, and nat&rsquo;r&rsquo;ly concluded that it was the compass. So I
      jest examined it, an sure enough, I found the needle all rusted up; an I&rsquo;m
      a leetle mite afeared it ain&rsquo;t no more good, jest now, than a rusty nail.
      Consequently, I don&rsquo;t feel like settin any very great confidence on her.
      Wal, for that matter, I never thought much of compasses, an don&rsquo;t
      gen&rsquo;rally go by them when I&rsquo;m in old Fundy, though here-, abouts they
      might p&rsquo;aps be some use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this fresh instance of Captain Corbet&rsquo;s way of navigating, Bruce was so
      overwhelmed that he could not say a single word. A flush passed over his
      face. His lips parted as though he was about to speak; but he checked the
      rising remark, and walked forward, where he began to talk earnestly with
      the other boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly their conversation was interrupted. There was a sharp crash,
      a wild flap, a dark shadow, and in an instant a large object floated away
      through the air on the wings of the wind, while the noise of flapping,
      snapping, and cracking still filled their ears. A hurried, startled glance
      showed them all. As the Antelope was coming round, a gust of wind more
      violent than usual had struck her. The old sails were too weak to stand
      it. The mainsail yielded utterly, and was torn clean off, and flung away
      upon the waters. The foresail had suffered but little less injury, for it
      had been torn completely asunder, and now showed a huge rent, while the
      two portions flapped wildly and furiously in the blast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, &ldquo;ef&mdash;this&mdash;here&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;beat&mdash;all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment, and stood contemplating the ruin before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; he continued, drawing a long breath, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s got to be must be. I
      knowed it would come some day. You can&rsquo;t fight agin the wind an storm for
      more&rsquo;n seventeen year without feelin it; and these sails has been an had
      their day. I knowed it. I told you, boys, once&mdash;I dar say you mind
      the time&mdash;that them sails might be stronger, and that they wasn&rsquo;t
      adapted to be hung on to a ship of a thousand ton. Still I did hope that
      they&rsquo;d stand this here vyge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are we going to do now, captain?&rdquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;O, wal, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t so bad&rsquo;s it might be.
      We&rsquo;ve got the foresail yet; an me and Wade &rsquo;ll fix her; we&rsquo;ll take
      her, an sew her up, and make her as good as new; an we&rsquo;ll work along some
      how. You needn&rsquo;t be troubled; it ain&rsquo;t goin to make a mite of difference;
      an I don&rsquo;t know, after all, but what in the long run p&rsquo;aps it&rsquo;s a goin to
      be better for us. We ain&rsquo;t ben a doin much with the two sails, that
      sartain; p&rsquo;aps now we&rsquo;ll do better with only one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now the venerable captain and his noble mate prepared to obtain
      possession of the sail. This was done without any very great effort, the
      boys all assisting. Then the two navigators (master and mate), having
      armed themselves with sail-needles and twine, proceeded to sew up the
      rent, to patch, to mend, and, in general, to renovate the old, old wornout
      sail. At length this last was happily accomplished; the sail was restored
      to its place, and as it swelled out at the pressure of the ocean blast, it
      seemed as efficient as ever. But either, in this case, appearances were
      deceptive, or else its previous condition had been deplorably weak.
      Certain it is, that after having sustained the blast for about half an
      hour, the old rag of a sail began to give way again in a dozen different
      places, and at length split up almost close beside the former rent. At
      this Captain Corbet surveyed the tattered canvas with melancholy
      resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This here wind,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a leetle too stiff for her jest now. I
      think we&rsquo;d better save her from another time. She&rsquo;ll do very well in
      milder weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By &ldquo;she&rdquo; Captain Corbet meant the sail, which he thus personified with
      affectionate familiarity. As he said this, he proceeded to lower the
      tattered canvas, and examine it in a pitying, compassionate, and caressing
      sort of way, quite oblivious of any other duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Antelope tossed and pitched about at the mercy of the waves.
      There was nothing that deserved the name of a storm; yet, nevertheless,
      the wind was boisterous, and the sea somewhat rough. The position of the
      Antelope became, therefore, in the highest degree unpleasant, and this
      last example of Captain Corbet&rsquo;s helplessness and incapacity served to
      complete the despondency of the boys. It now seemed as though their last
      hope had gone. The compass was useless; the sails were reduced to rags;
      they had no means of flight from their present misery; and the only
      comfort remaining was, that the danger which menaced them was not
      immediate, and might yet be evaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing now was left to the boys but to watch with eager eyes the scene
      around&mdash;to search over the waste of waters with the hope of seeing
      some sail, or perhaps some sign of land. And to this they devoted
      themselves. It was indeed a cheerless task, and one, too, which gave them
      but little hope. Hours passed, yet no sail appeared. Dinner time came, and
      the dinner was spread; yet the boys showed but little appetite. They had
      been in far worse circumstances than this, yet still this was sufficiently
      unpleasant to destroy all relish for Solomon&rsquo;s cookery, even if the
      banquet had been composed of greater dainties than salt pork and sea
      biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the guests at that banquet were not at all appreciative; and they sat
      there in the schooner&rsquo;s hold, not to eat, but merely to pass the time,
      which hung so heavy on their hands. Yet even thus their impatience did not
      allow them to spend much time at the dinner, for they soon retreated, and
      took up their stations on deck once more, to stare around, to scan the
      horizon, and to peer into empty space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hours passed. On that afternoon, the wind gradually went down, and there
      seemed a prospect of calmer weather. Captain Corbet began to talk of
      mending the sail, and hoisting it again; and at length, calling upon Wade,
      he and his mate proceeded with needles and sail twine to patch up as
      before. Into this occupation these two plunged, but the boys still stood
      on the lookout.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, Bart directed Bruce&rsquo;s attention to something which appeared on
      the margin of the sea, far away on the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bruce,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see something out there that looks like the
      mast of a vessel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bruce looked eagerly in the direction where Bart was pointing, and the
      others, who had heard the remark, did the same.

      they all stood looking in the direction where Bart was pointing,&mdash;
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly the mast, and the mast of a ship,
      for there is the yard and the rigging; but there&rsquo;s only one mast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sloop,&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a square-rigged vessel of some sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it ain&rsquo;t got no more &rsquo;n one mast,&rdquo; said Pat; &ldquo;an be the
      same token, there&rsquo;s no hull at all at all. Be the powers, but it would be
      a quare thing intirely if it was to turrun out to be another wather-logged
      ship. An if it is, it&rsquo;s meself that&rsquo;ll not set fut aboord of her; not me,
      so it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;that may be a hull. I can see it
      sometimes quite plain. Now look, boys, carefully, all of you, as we rise
      on the top of a wave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this time Arthur had been examining the object through the spy-glass.
      As Bruce said this, he handed the glass to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a ship,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;nor a vessel of any kind. It&rsquo;s land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land!&rdquo; cried all the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      All were silent. Bruce took a look through the glass, and then passed it
      to Bart, who, after looking through it, passed it on to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s land; and that&rsquo;s a flag-staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very low land,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mere sand-bank,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sand-bank,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;with a flag-staff in the middle of the ocean!
      It&rsquo;s queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bruce; &ldquo;and remember this, too, that this sand-bank in the
      ocean, with this flagstaff, is probably not very far away from the coast
      of Nova Scotia. Now, put this and that together, boys, and where do you
      think we are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this question they all looked at one another in silence, and for a time
      no answer was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, at length, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, boys. I believe
      that another prophecy of Captain Ferguson&rsquo;s is turning out true. He
      prophesied that we&rsquo;d be thrown upon Anticosti, and so we were. He
      prophesied that we&rsquo;d be thrown on another place, and this is that place.
      You all know what I mean. I mean Sable Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys made no remark. This thought had been in the minds of all of
      them. It was a thought that brought the deepest anxiety and gloom. For,
      bad as Anticosti was, there was one worse place; and that place was the
      very sand-bank before them&mdash;Sable Island!
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys had all along been hoping for deliverance, either in the shape of
      some passing vessel or some sign of land. But this land, which they had
      approached unwittingly, seemed to be surrounded by a terror far worse than
      anything that was connected with their present situation. For Sable Island&mdash;that
      treacherous sand-bank in the midst of the sea&mdash;had always been known
      to all of them as the dread of seamen, the trap of ships, and the
      graveyard of shipwrecked sailors. The solitary flag-staff rose there out
      of the low island, as though to warn them away, like a signal of danger;
      and yet it was impossible for them to move away. Without sails, and
      without a compass, they were helpless; and there seemed now no prospect,
      except to go ashore there and meet their doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was the first to rouse himself. &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s Sable
      Island. Come and take a good look at it, for we&rsquo;re going ashore.&rdquo; Captain
      Corbet had been so intent upon his work of patching the old sail, that he
      had heard and seen nothing of this excitement among the boys. These words
      of Tom came, therefore, suddenly and abruptly, and filled him with a
      terror equal to theirs. He started as though he had been shot. His needle
      dropped from his hands. For a few moments he sat staring at Tom; and then
      he rose slowly to his feet, and going over to where the boys stood, he
      looked out over the waters to where their eyes were directed. He stood
      staring for a long time in perfect silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sable Island!&rdquo; he at length said, in a low voice. &ldquo;Wal, boys,&mdash;I
      didn&rsquo;t ever think&mdash;I&rsquo;d ever live&mdash;to see&mdash;this here day.
      I&rsquo;ve ben a tryin all my life, boys, to keep clar of this here island; but
      fate&rsquo;s stronger than the hand of man,&mdash;an here we air!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, see here now,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Come, now, captain, this here sort of thing
      won&rsquo;t do at all, you know. There can&rsquo;t be any very great danger. The
      wind&rsquo;s gone down, you know. The sea&rsquo;s ever so much smoother than it was,
      and it&rsquo;s going to be smoother still. All sorts of vessels visit this
      island. The Nova Scotia government send supplies here regularly; and so I
      don&rsquo;t see what danger there is. For my part, I think we&rsquo;d all better go
      ashore. The more I think of it, the more convinced I am that we&rsquo;ll be
      better off ashore on Sable Island than we are drifting about on board of
      the Antelope. And so I say, Hurrah, boys, for Sable Island! Let&rsquo;s go
      ashore, and get a decent sail for this vessel, and some supplies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words cheered the boys amazingly. A reaction at once took place. Tom
      was right. The sea was calm enough here to admit of a landing anywhere:
      and in the face of this fact thoughts of danger were not to be
      entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the panic which had been inspired by the very name of Sable Island may
      easily be explained; and, in circumstances like these, it was quite
      justifiable. For of all places in the world, Sable Island is, perhaps,
      most dreaded by seamen. It is a low sand-bank, about twenty miles long and
      one mile wide. This much is above water. But besides what is visible to
      the eye, there is much more invisible, treacherous, beneath the sea,
      extending all around it. Sable Island is, in fact, the crest of a vast
      sand-bank or shoal, which rises out of the ocean depths, about a hundred
      miles southeast of the coast of Nova Scotia, in the very track of the vast
      commerce between England and America. Though the island itself is not more
      than twenty miles long, the shoal extends much farther; and it has been
      calculated that, for a distance of fifty miles, there is danger to the
      ship which ventures too near. Moreover, this shoal runs in a curved line,
      and may be said to enclose in a segment of a dangerous circle all vessels
      sailing north of it, or between it and the main land. Approach to it in a
      storm is always dangerous; and with certain winds it is positive
      destruction; wherefore ships always give it a wide berth. Many are the
      vessels which are known to have been lost there; but many more, by far,
      are supposed to have perished on the outlying shoals, without leaving a
      vestige behind to tell of their fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, there was nothing like a storm. The wind, that had prevailed
      all day, was gone; and it only needed Tom&rsquo;s cheery words to drive away
      from all of them the terror that for a time had taken possession of their
      souls. They therefore roused themselves from the silence and the gloom
      into which they had fallen, and began to talk over the probabilities of a
      landing. Each one brought forth all that he knew about Sable Island, and
      added it to the common stock of knowledge, until at length a very
      favorable idea of the place was formed. Bart knew that there was a regular
      overseer, or governor, or superintendent of the island, placed there by
      the Nova Scotia government. Bruce knew that a vessel was sent there four
      times a year to convey supplies, and to take away any shipwrecked people
      who might be there. Arthur knew that there were huts, built for the
      purposes of refuge, in different parts of the island. Tom was sure that a
      landing could be made in ordinary weather, without much trouble; and Phil
      was eloquent on the subject of the ponies which live and thrive on the
      island, constituting a peculiar breed, well known in Nova Scotia, where a
      batch of Sable Island ponies are brought every year, sold at auction, and
      dispersed through the country. The result of this interchange of ideas
      was, that the boys at length began to look upon Sable Island as rather a
      desirable place, and to feel impatient for the time to come when they
      might drift near enough to make a landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was a thing for which they had to wait. The Antelope was
      certainly drifting; yet her progress was slow, and there was no way of
      hastening it. For hour after hour they watched the flag-staff, and the low
      line of land away on the horizon, without finding themselves near enough
      to think of going ashore. By the shifting and changing position of the
      flag-staff, they knew that they were drifting past it; and yet there was
      no way by which they could prevent this. In the first moments of their
      panic, the possibility of drifting clear of Sable Island would have seemed
      most welcome to all of them; but now that they had formed the plan of
      landing there, such a prospect seemed not at all desirable; and the slow
      drift of the schooner, while it baffled their hopes, filled them all with
      impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way the hours of the day passed away. It was about three o&rsquo;clock
      in the afternoon when they first saw Sable Island. The hours went by, and
      sunset came; still they were not near enough. Night was impending, yet the
      weather was too calm to allow of uneasiness, and they could only hope that
      on the following day they might be able to make the landing which they all
      desired so earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing the night in the vicinity of such a place as Sable Island is what
      few would choose for any amount of money. On this occasion, most
      fortunately, the weather was calm. The wind had died away to a gentle
      breeze, and the water was quite smooth. The only motion experienced by
      those on board the Antelope was that long rise and fall which is always
      felt out at sea, owing to the never-ending undulation of the ocean waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys went below and slept. Captain Corbet, however, remained on deck,
      and kept his lonely vigil far into the night. The first mention of Sable
      Island had produced upon him a profound effect. His first words exhibited
      something like a panic terror, which might have communicated itself to the
      boys, had it not been for Tom&rsquo;s cheery exhortation. From that first terror
      the captain had managed to extricate himself; yet still there remained,
      deep within his soul, the gloomiest anticipations. The night was not
      particularly dark. The sky was dotted with innumerable stars; yet so low
      was the island, and so destitute of any conspicuous landmark, that it
      passed out of view with the early twilight; nor was the eagle eye of the
      watchful Corbet able to detect any sign of the vanished land. At length he
      determined to guard against the danger of any further drifting, and
      accordingly proceeded to let fall the anchor. It was about two hours after
      midnight when this was done, and the rattle of the chains awaked the
      sleepers below, and announced that at last their long wanderings were
      arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning they were all on deck with the dawn of day, and
      looking out eagerly upon the waters. The sight which met their eyes was
      one which could have given nothing like pleasure to any others; yet to
      them it was indeed pleasant, so far as it went. They saw rising out of the
      sea a low, sandy shore, which extended as far as the eye could reach.
      About opposite them rose a flag-staff, which they supposed to be the one
      that they had seen on the previous evening, though there was a difference
      of a most important character between what they saw then and now. For here
      they saw buildings which looked like comfortable residences, perhaps the
      abode of the keeper of the island. Except this house and its belongings,
      nothing else was visible along that sandy shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Antelope had come to anchor in good time, and the shore was not quite
      two miles away from this place. Still, so shallow were the waters, and so
      treacherous the sea bottom, that it was not at all advisable to attempt to
      approach nearer. If they wished to land, they would have to do so in the
      boat. The boat floated astern, all ready, being no other than that one
      which they had saved from the ship Petrel. Into this they prepared to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this voyage all the boys volunteered, and Captain Corbet also. Wade
      was to be left aboard with Solomon. Bart noticed that the venerable
      African was looking at the island with a pensive gaze, and thought that he
      saw disappointment in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to come ashore, too, Solomon?&rdquo; he asked, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darsn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Darsn&rsquo;t, no how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh, nonsense! Why not? Come along,&rdquo; said Bart, who thought that this
      was some of Solomon&rsquo;s superstitious fancies which were now affecting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darsn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Solomon, again. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t ebber leave it agin. An don you
      go an try to &rsquo;suade dis yer ole man, Mas&rsquo;r Bart, if you don want to
      lose him. Tell you what&mdash;dat ar island&rsquo;s too safe; an ef I foun
      myself dar, I wouldn&rsquo;t ebber leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe? What from?&rdquo; asked Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon looked all around with the glance of one who fears pursuit and
      capture by some mysterious enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De ole complaint,&rdquo; said he at last, with a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, rheumatism?&rdquo; asked Bart, innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sah,&rdquo; said Solomon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Broom-atiz&mdash;an acute Broomatiz too&mdash;what
      I notches from de ole woman whenebber she finds a broomstick handy. It
      generally attacks me over de back and shoulders. An what&rsquo;s wuss, dar ain&rsquo;t
      a medicine, or a liniment, or a wash, or a poultice, dat does a mite ob
      good. De only cure is for me to go an hunt up some desert island in de
      middle ob de ocean, an habit it for do ress ob my days; an so, ef I was to
      go shore dar, I might hide, an nebber come back. Too great &rsquo;tractium;
      couldn&rsquo;t resist it. Safe dar forebbermo from dat ar ole woman; safe an
      free; no more knocks an bruises; no more terror. O, Mas&rsquo;r Bart, p&rsquo;raps,
      after all, dis here ole man better go asho dar, an hab peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Solomon,&rdquo; said Bart, who was astonished at learning the real
      cause of Solomon&rsquo;s strange fancy for Sable Island. &ldquo;Nonsense. Don&rsquo;t get
      that notion into your head. Your wife &rsquo;ll never find you. You come
      to Grand Pré, and Dr. Porter will protect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat ar place is de berry place whar I kin nebber be safe. She&rsquo;s dar now,
      a waitin, an a watch-in, an a waitin for me. I know it. I feel it in my
      ole bones. Dey allers aches when I think ob her. Ebery mile we go brings
      me nearer to her broom-handle; an de longer I stay away, de wuss I&rsquo;m goin
      to cotch it. So, p&rsquo;raps, Mas&rsquo;r Bart, I&rsquo;d better go asho on Sable Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The idea seemed to have taken full possession of Solomon&rsquo;s mind, and to
      such an extent, that Bart found all efforts to banish it utterly useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He therefore gave it up, and concluded, under the circumstances, that it
      was better for Solomon to remain on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat was now ready. The boys and Captain Corbet were calling for Bart
      to hurry up. Bart got on board, and they pulled away. It was a long pull;
      but the water was smooth, and they made good progress. At length the boat
      touched the shore, and they all leaped out upon the sand.

      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN they stepped ashore
      upon Sable Island they found themselves in the presence of the whole of
      the population. This population amounted to about eleven souls; namely,
      the governor, or keeper, or guardian, or regent, or whatever else he may
      be called, of the island, six of the members of his family of various
      ages, and four able-bodied men. The governor was a bluff,
      broad-shouldered, red-faced, bearded personage, with a bright gray eye and
      a cheery smile. He had a reefing-jacket and &ldquo;sou&rsquo;-wester&rdquo; hat; while his
      four satellites were dressed, two in reefers, and two in Guernsey jackets.
      The intercourse of the Sable Islanders with the outside world was very
      infrequent, and usually very exciting, so that on the present occasion
      they had turned out in force to greet their extraordinary visitors.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far off was a substantial and comfortable-looking house, that seemed
      well adapted to withstand the Atlantic storms, and shelter its inmates
      from the severity of the weather. A few small out-houses adjoined it, and
      in the distance, where the ground rose a little higher than usual, was the
      signal-staff already mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever doubts the visitors might have had about the reception which they
      would meet with were dispelled at once and utterly by the first words of
      the potentate, whom I will call the &ldquo;Governor.&rdquo; Without any remark as to
      the suddenness of their appearance, and without any question about their
      errand, he at once shook hands with them all round, and invited them to
      the house to breakfast, which, he informed them, was all ready, and
      waiting for them. A long and dreary voyage and monotonous sea life made a
      meal on shore seem attractive beyond expression to all of them, and the
      kind invitation was most thankfully accepted. Whereupon the governor led
      the way to the house above-mentioned, and ushered his visitors into a
      large but low room, where a long table was spread, and lay invitingly
      before their eyes. Here they seated themselves, and partook of the
      governor&rsquo;s Sable Island hospitality, in the shape of fragrant coffee, and
      hot rolls, and baked potatoes, and corned beef and tongue, with other
      articles too numerous to mention; all of which served to efface from the
      minds of the guests the memory of late hardships, and to diffuse among
      them a general feeling of peace and calm, of cheerfulness and content.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of this repast the visitors made known to the governor their
      whole story, and that story was heard by him with an astonishment which he
      did not attempt to conceal. The fact that they should have been drifting
      blindly about without finding any place of refuge, and that they had
      finally been forced to seek for help from him in this place, of all
      others, was so overwhelming, that at first he seemed unable to believe it;
      and even after he had been compelled to yield his faith, his reason
      remained unsatisfied. The thing was true, yet unintelligible, and to his
      mind simply preposterous. Yet there was the fact, and here were the
      factors, that went to constitute that fact. The governor was dumfounded.
      Captain Corbet was clearly beyond him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, like a wise man, he gave up the attempt to fathom what was
      inscrutable, and devoted himself rather to the practical duties of
      hospitality. He promised to let Captain Corbet have what he wanted, and
      also he offered to do the honors of Sable Island, and show the boys all
      that was worth seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor was thus not only hospitable, but also very communicative. He
      told them all about Sable Island, and gave them much information, in
      addition to what they had already learned about this singular place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little colony was placed here for the purpose of giving aid and
      comfort to any who might be unfortunate enough to be shipwrecked here.
      Full supplies of all sorts of stores and provisions were placed on the
      island under his care. In addition to the buildings at this place there
      were two other houses of refuge, farther away towards the east, and also
      two other signal-staffs. In the other houses of refuge no one lived, but
      supplies of food and fuel were laid up there for the benefit of those who
      might need them. There was no lighthouse, because it was believed that a
      light might have a tendency to mislead, and because all seamen sought to
      keep as far away as possible from the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sable Island, in fact, is nothing more than the ridge of a vast sand-bank,
      which rises from the ocean depths, and at this place emerges for a few
      feet above its surface. The sandy ridge is over twenty miles in length,
      and is curved in its form. The shallows at either extremity also follow
      this curved line, so that the whole extent of this place of danger,
      including the shoals as well as the island, is not much less than fifty
      miles. Its concave side is towards the north-west, and ships on that side
      in stormy weather are in great peril whenever they come within twenty
      miles of the place. As a consequence, many wrecks occur, some of which are
      known, while more are never heard of, and can only be conjectured. Caught,
      so to speak, between the long-extended arms of this treacherous sand-bank,
      they are swept helplessly to destruction among the waters that rage over
      these far-reaching shoals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once every three months a vessel comes here from Nova Scotia to bring
      supplies and to take off any who may have been cast ashore. The landing is
      often difficult, and sometimes impossible, so that the vessel has to keep
      away for a long time before daring to venture near.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor informed them that life here, on the whole, was not
      unpleasant, but that in winter there were times when it was impossible to
      venture forth out of the house. The cold was never excessive, for the
      surrounding waters made the temperature milder than that of the adjacent
      main land; but the storms were terrific, and sometimes the sea seemed to
      make a clean sweep over the island, and all the air was filled with clouds
      of driving spray. After such storms as these it was always their practice
      to explore the island in search of shipwrecks. Sometimes they found human
      beings, who had been cast ashore, huddled for shelter behind hillocks, or
      in the other houses of refuge and brought them back; but more frequently
      the only result of their search was the sight of some fragments of a lost
      ship which the furious waves had washed ashore; or, worse still, the
      lifeless bodies of those who had perished amid the raging waters. These
      last were always conveyed to the burial-ground of the island, where they
      were committed to the grave with solemn ceremony, the governor reading
      over them the burial service of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      This information and much more was communicated at breakfast; and after
      the repast was over, the governor proceeded to fulfil his promise by
      taking the boys out to show them Sable Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not appear as though there could be much to see. On leaving the
      house there spread away a sandy waste, whereon grew some coarse grass.
      This grass grew not close enough to form anything like turf, yet in
      sufficient abundance to afford pasturage to herds of wild ponies which
      belong to the island. These ponies were put here many years ago, and in
      successive generations have become developed into a wonderfully
      intelligent and hardy little animal, ugly, woolly, yet strong, and capable
      of feeding on anything. They endure the severity of the winter season here
      without any shelter whatever; and when snow is on the ground they get at
      the grass underneath with the same ready instinct that is exhibited by the
      buffaloes on the western prairies.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking some distance, they reached the crest of the sand ridge, and
      from this place they saw a long, narrow sheet of water. This they were
      informed was a lake, which took up half of the length of the island, being
      more than ten miles in length; the formation of the island being what may
      be called a long, irregular oval, enclosing this sheet of water. The
      eastern half of the island is, however, a solid, continuous sand-bank, and
      the lake lies rather towards its western end.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the eastern end which is most affected by storms. Here the herbage
      is scanter, and the hillocks more frequent; here, too, the sand shifts and
      changes with every storm. The governor informed them that after every very
      great storm, important changes might be seen in this direction, and
      mentioned that one of a very interesting nature had occurred a few months
      previously in a tremendous equinoctial gale, which had been by far the
      wildest that had taken place since his residence on the island. This he
      promised to show them, and led the way to the place where the object to
      which he referred might be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked about four miles, and at length reached a pond which was about
      in the middle of the island, and at an equal distance from either side.
      Here a black object arose, which the boys at first took for some sort of a
      rock. As they drew nearer, it looked more like a hut; but finally, on
      coming close, they saw, to their utter amazement, that it was nothing else
      than the hull of a ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      That ship had a most singular form. The timbers had been greatly broken,
      and the decks had vanished long ago; but the outlines were visible by the
      broken beams, and it seemed to have been about five or six hundred tons
      burden. But what most impressed them was the quaint and singular
      appearance of the stern. This part had been less injured than the rest. It
      rose to a height of over sixteen feet, and much more was still buried in
      the sand. The uppermost portion was battered and broken; but beneath this
      there was a second deck and a third. Between this second deck and the
      third was what might once have been a cabin, and the broken port-holes
      astern, that once gave light, were still plainly visible. The great height
      of the stern and its division into successive stories, reminded the boys
      of the pictures which they had seen of the ships of three centuries back,
      and filled their minds with intense excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ship,&rdquo; said the governor, &ldquo;was uncovered by the great gale of last
      March. Until that time it had been completely covered by the sand, which
      formed around it the biggest hillock on the island. I never had any idea
      that inside of that hillock there was anything of this sort. I attributed
      the formation of the hillock to the accidental concurrence of the winds
      which had gathered the sand up here. You would scarcely believe how large
      it was. Why, for hundreds of yards all around here that hill extended, and
      it was over thirty feet higher than where we now are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a few days after the great gale, I came out in this direction, and
      noticed, to my amazement, that the hill was gone! That didn&rsquo;t surprise me
      much, for I had known other such changes to take place in every storm,
      though I had never known any on such an extensive scale. But when I came
      nearer, and saw this old hull, you may depend upon it I was astonished
      enough. Here it was,&mdash;all laid bare, all the sand blown away just as
      you see it now, except the cabin there, which I proceeded to clear out as
      soon as I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, the first glance showed me that this old hull must be at least a
      couple of hundred years old; and I took it for one of the old French or
      English ships that had been wrecked here in the early days of American
      colonization. I accounted for its position so far inland in the easiest
      manner in the world. The fact is, this whole island is all the time
      shifting and changing. I don&rsquo;t believe it is in the least like what it
      used to be. When this ship got here, I believe this was a shoal where she
      drove ashore in some tremendous gale, and was soon covered up with sand.
      Gradually the sand gathered about her more and more, and the island
      changed its shape, and the shoal rose above the water, till at last this
      place became the middle of the island. Two or three hundred years from
      this, I dare say there&rsquo;ll be miles of land away off there to the north,
      all along, and this&rsquo;ll be considered the South Shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you find anything aboard of her?&rdquo; asked Bart, in eager
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that was the very first thing I thought of. This old-fashioned ship
      reminded me of the Spanish galleons that used to take cargoes of gold and
      silver across the water, and I was full of the idea that there might be
      some immense treasure still on board. The sand had preserved the wood from
      decay, and gold was still more likely to be preserved. So I hurried back
      at once, and got a shovel, and came here alone. I cleared out the whole
      cabin there that day, and to my deep disappointment, I found not one
      single thing. I found it, in fact, just as you see it now&mdash;completely
      cleaned out by the waves. Everything had gone, except the timbers and some
      of the deck work. Doors had been torn off, and the whole front of the
      quarterdeck had been forced away. There were no movables of any kind,
      nothing, in fact, except those beams and planks, that had been strong
      enough to resist the fury of the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went back that day in deep disappointment, and gave up all hope of
      finding anything. On the following day I called all hands together, and we
      all came here to examine the hull. We worked for about a week, and dug out
      most of the sand,&mdash;it&rsquo;s all back again, though, you see,&mdash;and in
      other places we thrust in poles to see if anything was there. We found
      nothing, however; no gold or silver, no precious stones; nothing, in fact,
      but a rusty, demoralized, and depraved old cannon, that looked as though
      it had been cast for the Spanish Armada. The old piece is over there in
      the house, preserved as a curiosity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you didn&rsquo;t get anything?&rdquo; said Bruce, in a tone of disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing, except the cannon,&rdquo; said the governor; &ldquo;and I leave you to
      imagine my disappointment. I was at first sure of making my fortune,
      retiring from the island at once, and going home to live on my wealth. But
      I&rsquo;m afraid I shall have to postpone that for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose there ever was any treasure on board of her?&rdquo; asked
      Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes. I not only suppose so, but I almost feel certain that at one
      time there was a good deal of gold and silver aboard of this very ship.
      I&rsquo;ve examined her, and studied her very attentively. Look at her now for
      yourselves. Notice how high that stern is. I don&rsquo;t think those high sterns
      were used later than the days of Queen Elizabeth. It was in just such
      ships as this that the Spaniards brought their gold and silver across the
      water. In fact, boys, I believe that this is neither more nor less than a
      Spanish galleon. Believe? in fact I know it. For on that old gun that I
      spoke of, there is a cast that&rsquo;s precisely the same that you see on the
      old Spanish dollars&mdash;the arms of Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll tell you what the idea is that I&rsquo;ve formed about this ship. You
      know that in the days of Elizabeth the Spanish Main swarmed with
      buccaneers, who seized the treasure ships whenever they could. Among
      these, English sailors were the worst. You know that well enough. Well, my
      idea is, that some of these buccaneers seized this very galleon, plundered
      her of everything, and let her go. I don&rsquo;t think that a Spanish ship would
      have been likely to be driven up here from the West Indies, or to drift
      here. I think it most likely that she was seized and brought here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;the buccaneers were lost in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible, certainly,&rdquo; said the governor, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t quite think
      it. I think, if there had been any gold left, some of it would have been
      left hereabouts in the hull. No. I think it most likely that she has been
      plundered by the buccaneers, who then let her go,&mdash;for a big, clumsy
      ship, like this, was no good for their purposes. They may have let the
      Spanish sailors go in her,&mdash;not unlikely; and if so, the poor
      wretches left their bones in these sands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what would buccaneers come here for?&rdquo; asked Bart,&mdash;&ldquo;so far to
      the north. I thought they all lived around the Spanish Main.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the governor, &ldquo;that brings up the very point that proves my
      whole theory.&rdquo;

    <p>
      |[YOU must be aware, in the first place,&rdquo; said the governor, &ldquo;that over
      the whole Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia there are traditions of the
      buccaneers. There is one place, however, where these traditions seem to
      have a centre, and that is Mahone Bay. The people there have handed these
      traditions on from father to son ever since the country was settled; and
      the belief at this time, is as strong as ever, if not stronger. The only
      change that they have made is in the name. They do not speak of the
      buccaneers but of one certain man, whose name all over America seems to
      have lent itself to every tradition that the past has handed down about
      pirates and piracy. This is Captain Kidd. So at Mahone Bay the traditions
      all refer to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t believe that these traditions originated in nothing, but that
      they grew out of actual facts. The buccaneers, when they infested the
      Spanish Main, needed some place in which to store their plunder. They
      wanted a place which was at once safe from pursuit, and so remote that the
      Spaniards would never think of following them. Well, this they could gain
      by sailing far enough to the north, and Nova Scotia naturally seemed the
      best stopping-place; first, because it seemed to them like the last point
      of the coast of the main land, and secondly, because it was convenient for
      a run over to Europe. Besides, Nova Scotia afforded a greater number of
      first-rate harbors than could be found in any part, not only of America,
      but of the world. It was therefore out of the way of pursuit and
      discovery, and the best place that they could wish to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, among all the harbors that line the coast of Nova Scotia,
      there isn&rsquo;t any that can be compared to Mahone Bay for the purposes of the
      buccaneers. Once in it, and discovery or capture is next to impossible.
      The bay is spacious and deep, without shoals or currents, and, above all,
      dotted with three hundred and sixty-five islands of every sort and size.
      Among these a hiding-place could be found, that for safety and seclusion
      could not be equalled anywhere else. And what are the facts? Why, the
      tradition of the country ever since asserts that this very bay was a
      chosen haunt of pirates in the old piratical days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; continued the governor, &ldquo;this tradition isn&rsquo;t vague and
      general, but it&rsquo;s direct and specific. It points to some one place there,&mdash;one
      of those islands in particular that is distinguished from all the other
      islands. I don&rsquo;t know the name of it; I don&rsquo;t know that I ever heard it;
      but I do know that there is such an island,&mdash;one of those three
      hundred and sixty-five, that is pointed out and well known as the place
      frequented by the buccaneers. Everybody says, that on this island they
      lived, and that in this island, deep down,&mdash;under the level of the
      sea, in fact,&mdash;the buccaneers buried the plunder of the Spanish Main.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, as I said, they don&rsquo;t speak of the buccaneers, but of Captain
      Kidd. They call it Kidd&rsquo;s treasure. But it&rsquo;s all the same. The fact
      remains whatever changes mere names may undergo. Now, mind you, I don&rsquo;t
      say that there&rsquo;s any treasure there now,&mdash;it may have been all dug up
      by the very men who buried it, or by others who knew about it. It&rsquo;s a long
      time since it was buried, and Mahone Bay had no settlements for
      generations. At the same time it&rsquo;s quite probable that it may be there
      still; and I, for my part, shouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised to hear at any
      time that some lucky fellow has got hold of it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you never went to Mahone Bay yourself,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said the governor. &ldquo;The fact is, I never thought much about it
      until lately, after the old galleon set me speculating about it; and then
      I remembered old things that I had heard. Go there?&mdash;O, no!&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      too old. If I were a young man, without a family, I&rsquo;d make a dash at it;
      but now it&rsquo;s impossible. I&rsquo;d have to give up my situation. O. no! I dare
      say somebody&rsquo;ll make his fortune there one day; but that&rsquo;ll never be my
      luck. And as for treasure, I believe that there&rsquo;s lots of it deep under
      these sands, all about, if one only knew where to dig&mdash;but that&rsquo;s the
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, you see, that&rsquo;s the conclusion I&rsquo;ve come to&mdash;putting this
      and that together. This is a Spanish galleon. Here she is,&mdash;ever so
      far out of the course which the treasure ships of the Indies usually
      followed,&mdash;up here in these seas, in close proximity to the most
      notorious haunt of the old buccaneers. Do you suppose they had nothing to
      do with this? Of course they had&mdash;everything. In those days no ship
      in these waters could have escaped their eyes, much less a big Spanish
      ship full of gold and silver. Mark my words. As I said at first, they
      captured her, brought her here, unloaded her, buried her gold and her
      silver in Mahone Bay somewhere&mdash;on that island that I spoke of, and
      then let the ship go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This notion of the governor&rsquo;s might have been critically examined and
      utterly disproved by a competent person; but for such a task the boys were
      too ignorant and inexperienced. The firm belief of the governor in his
      extraordinary theory affected every one of the boys most profoundly; nor
      could any of them see a reason why it should not be perfectly true in
      every particular. Every word that he had uttered sank deep into their
      souls, and every one of them felt himself filled with an irresistible
      desire to hurry off at once to Mahone Bay, and seek for the island where
      the buccaneers had buried the plunder of the Spanish Main.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the present occasion they poured upon him a torrent of questions of all
      sorts, every one of which showed how attentively they had listened to his
      story, and how eager the curiosity was which they all felt. The governor
      answered everything with the minuteness and the exactness that
      characterize a man when he finds that his own particular hobby meets with
      respectful appreciation from others.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they turned back to the house, talking all the way about Spanish
      galleons, treasure ships, the buccaneers, gold, silver, diamonds, the
      Spanish Main, and the various haunts of the old marauders&mdash;subjects
      fascinating above all things to these boys, as they are to all boys, so
      fascinating indeed, that they were sorry when they came back to the house.
      Here, however, another pleasure awaited them, for the governor showed them
      the very gun that he had found on the old ship, and pointed with
      respectful pride to certain marks upon it. The gun was terribly rusty, and
      the marks had been so effaced that they were capable of being interpreted
      to mean anything; but the governor assured them that they were the
      escutcheon of the Royal House of Spain, and the boys believed it
      implicitly. Other and more critical inquirers would have asked what the
      governor meant by the arms of the Royal House of Spain, and inquired
      whether he meant the house of Arragon, or of Hapsburg, or of Bourbon. To
      the boys, however, such a question never occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The water was still calm; but Sable Island is a place where no one can
      stay long. The governor therefore hurried up the venerable Corbet,&mdash;who,
      on this as on other occasions, seemed to give indications of a dilatory
      disposition,&mdash;and furnished him with some sails, which, with a little
      alteration, would suit the Antelope very well. Upon this Corbet returned
      in his boat to the schooner, carrying the sails with him, and one of the
      Sable Islanders to help him rig the sails. The boys were to be put aboard
      by the governor later in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then went off with their genial host to other parts of the island.
      This journey was made on ponies which had been broken, yet not so much but
      that they retained a very fair share of their original wildness. The
      riding was not very conducive to speed. All of the boys were thrown, but
      none of them were hurt on the sandy soil, and the governor made himself
      merry over their horsemanship. As to scenery, there was nothing different
      from what they had already encountered, except numerous wild fowl that
      frequented the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time that they returned they saw the Antelope with her sails
      filled, and a boat drawn up on the beach to convey them aboard. The
      governor shook hands with them all most heartily on bidding them good by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good by, my lads,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the most unhappy of men in one way.
      Although I keep shipwrecked guests an immense time, I dare not be
      hospitable to visitors. I would press you to stay all night, but I&rsquo;m
      afraid to. If you had a better craft, and a better captain, I might
      venture to do it; but even then it wouldn&rsquo;t be safe. As it is, it would be
      madness, and my only parting word to you is, to hurry away as fast as you
      can, and get away as far as possible from Sable Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys got on board; the sturdy Sable Islanders bent to their oars, and
      soon their vigorous strokes drove the boat far out to sea. But all the way
      the boys could see the little group on the shore watching them. On
      reaching the Antelope, they found all ready for a start. The Sable
      Islander who had accompanied Captain Corbet returned with his companions;
      and as the Antelope moved away, the flag of the B. O. W. C. went up and
      down rapidly, and three ringing cheers burst forth from the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      So ended their very remarkable and eventful visit to the most fearful and
      dangerous of all the islands of the sea. Few, indeed, are the vessels
      which, having drifted upon this perilous coast, are able to leave it so
      safely, and so pleasantly. For Sable Island generally surrounds itself
      with destroying terrors for those who chance upon it; and more than
      Anticosti, more, indeed, than any other place, deserves the dread name of&mdash;&ldquo;the
      graveyard of ships and sailors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In turning away, there was now but one thought in the minds of all the
      boys, and that was, of course, Mahone Bay. In any case they would sail
      straight for the coast of Nova Scotia; and Mahone Bay was the only place
      at which they were willing to land. There was now no further difficulty
      about making their way, for the governor, in addition to the sails, had
      furnished a compass also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Nova Scotia coast,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, &ldquo;air doo north by west, an
      it ain&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n a hundred mile. The wind&rsquo;s fair, an we ought to sight it
      before&mdash;well, before three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we&rsquo;ll do it long before that,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;if this wind lasts. But why
      can&rsquo;t you head due west for Mahone Bay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, &ldquo;there air severial reasons why: fust an
      furmost, because, ef I sail west, I&rsquo;ll have to coast along this here
      shore, which is the very thing I don&rsquo;t want to do. I want to get as far
      away as I kin, an as quick as I kin. Second, I don&rsquo;t want to go in the
      dark no longer. I want to sight the Nova Scotia coast, and then to keep it
      in sight till I die. Never agin do I want to git out o&rsquo; sight o&rsquo; Nova
      Scotia. Then, third, I don&rsquo;t want to stop at no more places, but to
      contennew along my windin way, till I git to Minas. An, fourthly, I don&rsquo;t
      want to go to Mahone Bay at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not go to Mahone Bay!&rdquo; cried Bruce. &ldquo;Why not? Why, we want to hunt up
      that island that the buccaneers buried the treasure in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet looked at all the boys with an expression of solemn regret,
      mingled with mild reproach upon his venerable face. Then shaking his head
      mournfully, he slowly ejaculated,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, boys, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why not?&rdquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, boys! O, boys!&rdquo; continued the captain, in a dismal tone. &ldquo;An has it
      come to this? Air this the end an the melankilly result of the bitter
      teachins that you&rsquo;ve ben an had by sea an land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bitter teachings?&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;what bitter teachings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The teachins, an the warnins, an the experiences,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet,
      &ldquo;that&rsquo;s ben a heaped upon you&rsquo;s all. Why this thirst for perishable
      treasures? Why this yearnin for money-holes? Hain&rsquo;t you had enough of
      treasures, and dreams of wealth? Look aime, boys. Behold this wretched
      victuim of Avarice. Think how the demon of Avarice got possession of me in
      the Gulf of St. Lawrence, an drawed me away captive to his chariot wheels.
      Think how he tempted me to desert you, an leave you in tremenjous danger.
      Bar all this in mind, I humbly beg, and then desist. Say no more. Temp me
      not. Leave the aged Corbet be. Don&rsquo;t inflame this beaten heart. Be wise in
      time. You&rsquo;ll only suffer for it ef you don&rsquo;t. That thar treasure is
      onhallowed. Didn&rsquo;t we try diggin for buried treasures once afore? Answer
      me that. We did. An what was the result? I pause for a reply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, but this is different,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;That money-hole on the hill was
      all nonsense; and, besides, what was it then frightened us, except a
      miserable little donkey? This is a different matter. There ought to be
      something there, out of all the plunder of the Spanish Main.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about plunder, and the Spanish Main,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;The
      way that that governor had of rollin out them words of his was somethin
      that made a man feel a tinglin all over. It&rsquo;s the thirst for gold, boys;
      don&rsquo;t kindle it up to a flame; don&rsquo;t temp me agin my better natur: don&rsquo;t,
      don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, see here now, captain,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look at things in that way.
      When you left us on the ship, it wasn&rsquo;t Avarice; it was because you hadn&rsquo;t
      any idea that we were in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Avarice, the Demon of Gold&mdash;-nothing else. It blinded my eye,
      an hardened my heart. It&rsquo;s the way it allus does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see how you can call it Avarice. You only wanted money for
      your baby&mdash;you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of his tender offspring, Captain Corbet&rsquo;s face changed; a
      mild and mellow light beamed in his aged eye, and a tender parental
      fondness was visible in the expression of his venerable face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Terew!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;terew&mdash;as gospel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you must feel as anxious about him now as you were then. You
      failed that time; perhaps this time you&rsquo;ll succeed. And only think how
      jolly it would be, if you could make his fortune, and give him a college
      education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this crafty allusion to Captain Corbet&rsquo;s fondest hope, the aged
      navigator was overcome. His eyes became moistened with tears; a gentle
      sigh escaped him; he said no more, and all the boys saw that his silence
      meant consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Antelope was heading towards the nearest point on the Nova Scotia
      shore. That shore lay almost north, or north by west, and it was about a
      hundred miles distant. The wind was fair; there was no prospect whatever
      of a change for the worse; and so the Antelope walked the waters, as
      usual, like a thing of life, while the boys amused themselves with
      recalling the strange story of the governor of Sable Island, and in
      speculating about the probable appearance of that island of the
      buccaneers, which, according to him, had been the deposit and the
      burial-place of the plunder of the Spanish Main.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Antelope did her best. The wind was not very strong, yet it bore her
      along as fast as she was capable of going; no very great rate of speed, to
      be sure, yet fast enough to assure them, by sunset, that they were already
      far enough away from Sable Island to be out of the reach of danger; out of
      the grasp of its far-reaching arms, and in a pathway which brought them
      every moment nearer to a friendly shore.

      and during the following night the Antelope kept on her course. On the
      following day, by noon, they came within sight of land, and the distant
      coastline running along the horizon showed them now what course they
      should take. Captain Corbet now headed her a few points farther to the
      west. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right now,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Jest you let me see the Nova Scotia coast,
      and I&rsquo;ll foller it. Here we go now, an our motter air, On&rsquo;ard an up&rsquo;ard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Downward, rather than upward, is my motto,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m bound to
      get to the bottom of the treasure of the buccaneers. At any rate we ought
      to find out the truth about it; for the saying is, that truth lies at the
      bottom of a well, and a money-hole isn&rsquo;t very far different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you can manage to find Mahone Bay, captain?&rdquo; asked Bruce,
      with a very natural doubt about Captain Corbet&rsquo;s capacity to find his way
      to a strange place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said he,&ldquo;&rsquo;pears to me easy enough, with this here coast-line
      to guide us. You see all we&rsquo;ve got to do is, to keep on along this here
      coast till we come to Halifax harbor. Wal, we don&rsquo;t go in thar, but keep
      straighten. Wal, the next place is Margaret&rsquo;s Bay. That&rsquo;s easy enough; and
      then the next place is Mahone Bay. So you see it&rsquo;s so plain that a child
      might guide his tender canoe in safety to such a place as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I dare say we&rsquo;ll work our way sooner or later to Mahone Bay,&rdquo; said
      Phil; &ldquo;but what we are to do after we get there is a thing which, I
      confess, puzzles me a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we&rsquo;ll hunt about for the island,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Hunt about?&rdquo; said Phil.
      &ldquo;But how can we find it? Shall we ask people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no,&rdquo; said Bruce; &ldquo;that would never do. It wouldn&rsquo;t do at all to let a
      single soul know what we are after. They&rsquo;d all follow us, and interfere
      with us. No; we&rsquo;ve got to be very cautious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;we must keep dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I dare say,&rdquo; said Phil; &ldquo;but how can we find the island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we&rsquo;ll hunt it up,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can we tell it from Adam, or from any other island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an that&rsquo;s aisy enough,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re lookin for an island that&rsquo;s
      got a hole inside of it; an if there&rsquo;s a hole, sure we&rsquo;ll know it by the
      heap it makes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;we can look about, and if we can&rsquo;t find any
      marks to guide us, why, then we can make inquiries among the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With such vague plans as these, then, the boys looked forward to Mahone
      Bay, feeling that it was necessary to keep their purpose a profound
      secret, and yet not knowing how to find the island. They were unwilling to
      betray their errand by asking questions, and yet without asking how could
      they hope to learn anything? This was a difficulty which they all felt,
      and in the presence of it they could only conclude to be guided by
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days passed and the Antelope reached the entrance to Halifax harbor,
      which the bold captain recognized, not by any knowledge of his own, for he
      had never been here before; not by any chart or observation, for he did
      not own the former, and had not made the latter; but simply from seeing a
      steamer go up into the land towards a place where the sky was black with
      the smoke of bituminous coal. When he saw that, he said, &ldquo;This is
      Halifax;&rdquo; and, saying this, he felt secure of his position, and kept the
      vessel on due west.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was morning when they passed Halifax. By noon they passed a broad bay,
      which they decided to be Margaret&rsquo;s Bay. By evening they had reached
      another broad bay. At its mouth, and well out in the ocean, lay an island,
      with black and rocky sides, and wooded top. On sailing inside of this,
      they noticed that it was inhabited, and from this point of view showed
      houses and farms. A few miles farther on was another island, which was
      cultivated from one end to the other, and appeared to be thickly
      populated. Farther on there appeared other islands, and wooded shores, and
      cultivated fields, and high hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, they felt sure, was their destination&mdash;Ma-hone Bay. The
      Antelope passed inside of the second island, and here dropped anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was yet more than an hour before sundown, and the boys went ashore upon
      the island nearest to make inquiries, not about the plunder of the Spanish
      Main, but merely of a general nature. The island was thickly inhabited,
      and on walking a short distance from the beach where they had left their
      boat, they found a road which seemed well travelled, and appeared to run
      from one end of the island to the other. In a little while an old man came
      along on an ox-cart, who bowed with a good-natured smile, and remarked
      that it was a fine evening. To this they assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of this island?&rdquo; asked Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon being thus questioned, the old man stopped his oxen, and, looking
      around upon the young faces before him, he said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of this island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tancook,&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tancook?&rdquo; repeated Bruce; &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s the name of that other one?&rdquo;&mdash;pointing
      to the outer island, which they had first encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That thar?&rdquo; said the old man, looking where Bruce pointed,&mdash;&ldquo;that
      thar? Why, we call that thar island by the name of Ironbound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a fine name, a sonorous and at the same time an appropriate name,
      and deeply impressed the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine farming country this,&rdquo; said Bruce, once more plunging into the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, pooty so so,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t got no reason to complain;
      though, what with diphthery, an sich, it&rsquo;s mighty hard on children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good many people here, apparently,&rdquo; continued Bruce, in a lively key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, pooty tol&rsquo;ble,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;&rsquo;bout a hundred families
      on this here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farmers or fishermen?&rdquo; asked Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, a leetle of the one, an a leetle of the tother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a church here too,&rdquo; continued Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yas&mdash;a meetin-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What persuasion is that meeting-house?&rdquo; asked Bruce, in an anxious tone
      of voice, as though the fortunes of the whole party depended on the
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, mostly Baptist,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;though not all. Were kine o&rsquo; cut
      off, an live mostly to ourselves. But Tancook ain&rsquo;t sich a bad place,
      arter all, and we manage to grub along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine bay around here,&rdquo; said Bruce, with a grand, patronizing sweep
      of his right arm, which seemed meant to include all creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yas,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t nothin like it nowhar. We&rsquo;ve got
      three hundred and sixty-five islands, of all shapes an sizes, in this here
      bay&mdash;one for every day in the year. This here&rsquo;s the biggest, an the
      smallest isn&rsquo;t more than a yard long. Yas, it&rsquo;s a fine bay, an a great
      harbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred and sixty-five islands!&rdquo; exclaimed Bruce, in a tone of
      surprise. &ldquo;Is it possible? And one for every day in the year! How
      extraordinary! But is there really that exact number, or is it only
      fancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really an truly,&rdquo; said the old man, with whom this was evidently the
      deepest conviction of his mind. &ldquo;O, yas, thar&rsquo;s no mistake or doubt about
      it. They&rsquo;ve all been counted, over an over; yas, over an over&mdash;over
      an over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s most extraordinary; and now I dare
      say,&rdquo; he continued, in an insinuating way, &ldquo;I dare say that, among so many
      islands, some of them are well worth a visit. This island of yours is a
      perfect wonder&mdash;so fertile, so beautiful! Are there any others that
      are like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, not to say jest like this; but they&rsquo;re fine islands, many of them,
      an curous, too. Thar&rsquo;s some that&rsquo;s only islands at high tide, bein
      connected with the main land by narrer beaches an shoals at low tide: an
      then, agin, thar&rsquo;s others that&rsquo;s only islands at low&rsquo; tide, bein
      completely kivered up by the water at high tide; and so it goes; an some&rsquo;s
      cleared an inhabited, like this; an some&rsquo;s wild, an kivered with woods; an
      some has only one family on it; an some&rsquo;s cultivated, but has no one livin
      on them; an so we&rsquo;ve got all sorts, you see, an they&rsquo;re all well wuth
      visitin. Thar&rsquo;s Dead Man&rsquo;s Island, an Quaker Island, an Oak Island, an
      Maple Island, an Ironbound;&rdquo; and the old man went on to enumerate dozens
      of names in addition to these, out of which no individual one made any
      impression on the minds of his hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far Bruce had been questioning the old man chiefly with the hope that
      he might drop some remark which might be of use to them in their search
      after the treasure island. But no such remark was forthcoming, and the
      string of names which was enumerated conveyed no information whatever. So
      Bruce made one more effort, and ventured to come a little more to the
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This bay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has been a great place for buccaneers&mdash;so I&rsquo;ve
      heard. Do you know anything about them? Can you tell me of any island in
      particular that people talk of as being visited by them? There&rsquo;s one, I
      think, that the buccaneers used to visit. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard about them,
      and can tell us the name of the island, and where it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, this was pretty direct; indeed, all the other boys thought that it
      was altogether too direct, especially since they had all concluded that it
      was best not to ask any questions, except those of a general character.
      Bart and Tom both nudged Bruce very violently, to rebuke his rashness; but
      their nudges had no effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man stared, then frowned, then looked blank, and then frowned
      again. Then he looked at Bruce, and said, in an uncertain, hesitating way,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bucker nears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;Buccaneers. They used to come here, you know. Lots of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man wragged his old head up and down several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yas; I dar say. Buccar nears&mdash;an lots of other fish, that&rsquo;s left
      us. They used to come here in shoals&mdash;likewise mackerel; but them
      days is over. Sometimes shad an her&rsquo;n comes here now; but things ain&rsquo;t as
      they used to be, an it&rsquo;s gittin harder an harder every year for us
      fishermen. It&rsquo;s as much as a man can do, with farmin and fishin together,
      to find bread an butter for himself an his children. As to them&mdash;buck&mdash;buck&mdash;buck&mdash;fish,
      I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t mind ever hearin of them, leastways not under that
      thar name. P&rsquo;raps they&rsquo;re a kine&rsquo; o&rsquo; mackerel; an I only wish they&rsquo;d come
      now, as they used to when I was young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this extraordinary misapprehension of his meaning, Bruce stared, and
      seemed, for a moment, about to explain himself; but the other boys checked
      him, and the old man himself seemed to become suddenly lost in his
      remembrances of those days of youth, which might never be equalled now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you jump in, an take a ride?&rdquo; said he, at length. &ldquo;Air you goin my
      way? Ef so, you may as well git a lift as not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys thanked him, and excused themselves. They were not going his way,
      but in another direction. A few more words passed, and at length the old
      man bade them good by, whistled up his oxen, and moved forward. As for the
      boys, they did not feel inclined to pursue their investigations any
      further just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next time we ask,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to talk about Captain Kidd,
      plump and plain, and then perhaps they&rsquo;ll understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what use there is in proclaiming to the
      whole world our business. We&rsquo;d better cruise about for a while, and
      examine for ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing like dropping a quiet hint,
      interrogatively. It may bear fruit in the shape of useful information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the old man&rsquo;s information about the buccaneer mackerel,&rdquo; said Tom,
      with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruce deigned no reply. They waited here a little longer, and, after
      strolling about some distance farther, they went back to the boat, and
      returned to the Antelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Solomon addressed himself to Bart, secretly and in
      confidence, as the latter happened to be sitting on the windlass, trying
      to concoct some plan by which they might find the mysterious island that
      contained the buried treasure of the buccaneers,&mdash;the wonderful, the
      stupendous, the incalculable plunder of the Spanish Main. To him, thus
      meditating, cogitating, and reflecting, the aged Solomon thus addressed
      himself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all dis yar new &rsquo;posal, Mas&rsquo;r Bart, &rsquo;bout buried
      treasures, an tings? &rsquo;Pears to me youn all goin mad, an rushin head
      fo&rsquo;most into de jaws ob &rsquo;structium. Better look out, I say. Dars no
      knowin whar dis yar&rsquo;s goin to end. Dem dar pirates&rsquo; ghosts keep alius a
      flyin an a flittin roun de place whar dey bury de treasure, and it &lsquo;ll
      take more&rsquo;n you boys to tar dat ar plunder out of deir keepin. Dis yar
      scursion &rsquo;bout dis yar bay ain&rsquo;t goin to end in no good. Dar ain&rsquo;t
      a succumstance dat kin favor you; eberyting&rsquo;s clean agin you; an if you
      fine&rsquo; de hole whar de treasure&rsquo;s buried, it&rsquo;ll only bring roonatium an &rsquo;structium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;my aged, venerable, and revered friend, I am deeply
      pained at this exhibition of superstition in one who ought to have a soul
      above ghosts. A man like you, Solomon, who has real evils to suffer, who
      is afflicted by such real calamities as rheumatism, and what you call
      &lsquo;broomatism,&rsquo; ought to have a soul above ghosts. Isn&rsquo;t it enough for you
      to live in perpetual terror about the reappearance of that Gorgon who
      calls you husband, and beats you over the head with a poker, that you must
      take the trouble to get up a new set of afflictions, and trot out your
      superstitious fancies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mas&rsquo;r Bart,&rdquo; said Solomon, earnestly, &ldquo;look heah; dis yar ain&rsquo;t no common
      &rsquo;currence. Dar&rsquo;s death an roonatium afore us all. You&rsquo;re goin to &rsquo;sturb
      de &rsquo;pose ob de dead&mdash;an de worst sort ob dead. Dem&rsquo;s de sort
      dat won&rsquo;t stand no nonsense. I&rsquo;ve had &rsquo;nough ob money-holes, an
      diggin in em, for my time. De ghost ob a dead pirate ain&rsquo;t to be laughed
      at. Dey&rsquo;ll hab vengeance&mdash;sure&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re born. Dar&rsquo;s no sort ob use in
      temptin fate. Sure&rsquo;s you go down into dat ar money-hole, so sure you hab
      down on your shoulders de ghosts ob all de pirates dat eber was hung, an
      dem dat was unhung, too. So, Mas&rsquo;r Bart, don&rsquo;t you go foolin round here
      dis yar way. I&rsquo;se a ole man, Mas&rsquo;r Bart, an I&rsquo;se seen much ob de world, an
      I &rsquo;vise you to clar out, an not temp de ghosts ob de pirates in dis
      yar fashium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Solomon&rsquo;s warning was sincere, and was spoken with the utmost earnestness;
      but Bart was quite inaccessible to sincerity and earnestness. He laughed
      at Solomon&rsquo;s fears, reminded him of his foolish behavior on former
      occasions, brought to his memory the time when he had fled from the
      braying of an ass, and the other occasion when he had fled from the hoot
      of an owl. But, though Solomon could not help owning that he had acted on
      those occasions with shameful cowardice and folly, yet the consciousness
      of this could not lessen in the slightest degree the superstitious terrors
      that now filled his breast; and so, as Bart found him incorrigible, he had
      to give up the effort to calm his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night all on board slept more soundly than they had for weeks. The
      Antelope was anchored in smooth water, in a secure and sheltered harbor,
      near a friendly land, and no care whatever was in the minds of the boys,
      or of the captain. Such perfect freedom from anxiety had not been their
      lot for a long time; and in proportion to this peace of mind was the
      profoundness of their sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day they cruised all about the bay, keeping ever on the
      lookout for the Island of the Buccaneers. But they soon found that the
      search was hopeless under the conditions which they had imposed upon
      themselves. To seek for what is unknown, and not ask for directions, is
      surely one of the most impracticable of tasks. The experience which they
      had thus far had was enough, and they found themselves compelled either to
      give up the search altogether, or else to break through the secrecy which
      they had imposed upon themselves.

      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE cruise around Mahone
      Bay had thus proved useless, as might have been expected. The search after
      one island out of hundreds, where the appearance, and even the name, of
      that island were unknown to them, was certainly an extraordinary piece of
      folly. Had they allowed themselves to make direct inquiries, they could
      have found the island without any trouble. But this was the very thing
      which they were unwilling to do; partly, as has been said, from the fear
      of drawing attention to their proceedings, and of being interrupted or
      interfered with in some way; but partly, no doubt, because they found a
      much greater charm in movements which were thus surrounded by mystery. It
      was appropriate for the members of the great secret society of the B. O.
      W. C. to enter upon this new undertaking in secrecy. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      But now this had to be given up, and they concluded to go ashore at the
      chief settlement of the bay, and make inquiries. In these inquiries they
      resolved still to maintain their secret as far as possible, and not to
      divulge it unless it was absolutely necessary; they determined to hint,
      rather than ask, and obtain information indirectly, rather than directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief settlement of Mahone Bay is the town of Chester, one of the
      greatest curiosities in America. It is not a settlement. It is a town. It
      is situated on a peninsula, with a harbor on its front and on its rear.
      This peninsula is all laid out in streets, which cross one another at
      right angles, with perfect regularity. At the point where the peninsula
      terminates, is a spacious place, intended to serve as a promenade; and
      here there is a narrow shoal running off to another piece of land, which
      is a peninsula or an island by turns, as the shoal is covered or uncovered
      by the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a wonderful quaintness and quiet in Chester. It is the Nova
      Scotian representative of Sleepy Hollow. The streets, which are so nicely
      laid out, are all covered with turf, and are as green as the town lots on
      either side. The houses are all old; the people are all quiet and
      leisurely, taking the world in the easiest manner possible. The very dogs,
      affected by the peace and calm around, seem unwilling to bark, except
      under the strongest possible provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scenery around this quaint little town may safely be classed among the
      most beautiful in the world. The wide bay, with its hundreds of islands,
      forms an almost unequalled place for yachting. Many of the islands have
      curious names, associated with some curious legend. The waters abound with
      myriads of shell fish, and sometimes have a marvellous transparency. The
      winding shore of the bay forms one of the loveliest of drives, and affords
      perpetual variety of scenery; and the climate in summer time is so genial,
      that it forms the perfection of a watering-place for those who have to fly
      from the heat of southern latitudes. And this will one day be the destiny
      of Chester, when the world knows it; when the rush of parched travellers
      takes place; when great hotels face its promenade, and the streets, once
      laid out with so bold a design, are lined with houses and shops. Such
      changes will one day take place; but whether Chester will be then so
      altogether lovely as it is now in its Sleepy Hollow epoch, is a matter
      about which there may well be doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the place, then, in which the boys found themselves; and they all
      agreed with one opinion, that Chester was, in every respect, worthy of
      standing here in this lovely bay, in the immediate vicinity of the
      mysterious Island of the Buccaneers, where lay stored up the treasure of
      the sea and the plunder of the Spanish Main.
    </p>
    <p>
      On looking about the place, they came to an inn, which had such an air of
      comfort and tranquillity, and such a home-like appearance, that they
      determined to put up at it, and prosecute their investigations in a
      leisurely fashion. They arrived in time for dinner; and, if there had been
      any doubt in their minds as to the propriety of deserting the Antelope, it
      was dispelled at the appearance of the dinner which was served up. For
      there were salmon and green peas,&mdash;delicacies of which, like all good
      boys, they were particularly fond, and to which they had been strangers
      for a long time. There, too, were strawberries, the last of the season,
      with cream of the richest kind; and together with these were the mealiest
      of potatoes, the whitest of bread, the freshest of butter, and the most
      immaculate coffee. To all these things their late sea fare afforded a
      striking contrast, and Solomon&rsquo;s star declined sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord they found most good-natured, and most genial, like all the
      inhabitants of this favored spot. He was communicative about himself,
      proud of his town, proud of the scenery around, and yet not at all
      inquisitive as to the purposes of his guests. This seemed to them to be
      the very man whom they might interrogate without endangering their secret;
      for, while his communicativeness would lead him to tell everything that
      there was to be told, his lack of curiosity would prevent him from asking
      any unpleasant questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, as soon as they could get a convenient chance, they
      button-holed the landlord, and began a series of questions of a very
      non-committal character, referring chiefly to the scenery of Mahone Bay,
      and the places most worthy of a visit. They did not make the remotest
      reference to the buccaneers or to Captain Kidd, but seemed to have their
      thoughts occupied with scenery only.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord grew eloquent upon the theme of the scenery of Mahone Bay. He
      told them about the islands, and mentioned the number very particularly,
      insisting upon it that their number was exactly three hundred and
      sixty-five. He spoke of the drive along the shore, of a place called Gold
      River, where there was excellent fishing, and finally mentioned a place
      which he called Aspot-ogon. Upon this theme he grew more enthusiastic than
      ever. Aspotogon, he said, was the highest mountain on the Atlantic coast
      of Nova Scotia, and the approach to it afforded a view of the most
      remarkable scenery in the whole bay. This approach lay through a narrow
      inlet which ran to the base of the mountain, and was called Deep Cove. It
      was bordered by precipices, for a long way, on either side, and was a wild
      and romantic spot. It terminated in a circular basin, on one side of which
      was a deep declivity, by which they could find the shortest ascent to the
      summit of Aspotogon; and, in addition to this, they could find fishing and
      bathing to their hearts&rsquo; content.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all this, however, there was no mention made of any island like the one
      which they wished to find. He mentioned, indeed, the names of several
      islands, in a casual sort of way, but made no allusion to any legends of
      the buccaneers. The only reference which he made to treasure, was on the
      name of that fishing stream which he had described to them. This was Gold
      River; and the name excited their attention. Bart asked what the name had
      reference to; and the landlord replied, that it arose from the color of
      its water. This commonplace derivation of such a name disgusted and
      disappointed them all, for they hoped to hear of a different origin, and
      one more in accordance with their present purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord dwelt to a great extent on Aspotogon and Deep Cove, and
      finally offered to go there with them, if they felt inclined to make a
      visit to the place. Though the boys were still as eager as ever about the
      Island of the Buccaneers, yet they were by no means indifferent to the
      charms of a romantic place like this, nor at all disinclined to roam about
      the bay farther. The offer of the landlord was also an additional
      inducement, and they thought that in the intimacy of shipboard they might
      manage to get something more direct out of him, and learn from him all
      that there was to be learnt about any existing legends current among the
      people, such as the governor of Sable Island had mentioned. It was
      arranged, therefore, that they should go on the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner the boys started off in different directions. Bruce in a
      boat, Arthur along the shore, Tom and Phil over the hills, while Bart and
      Pat sauntered about the wharves, catching star-fish, sea-urchins, and
      jelly-fish, of which there were myriads. Towards evening they returned to
      the inn, and found the landlord seated on the steps. They seated
      themselves too, and gradually fell into a conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This bay must have been a great place in old times,&rdquo; said Bart, trying to
      feel his way as easily as possible towards the subject of the buccaneers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord shook his head with solemn emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tre&mdash;mendous!&rdquo; he slowly ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a capital place for hiding from any ship that might be chasing!&rdquo;
       said Bart; &ldquo;so many islands! Why, if a ship once got in here, she could
      never be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Best dodging-place in the world,&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;Lots of islands,
      lots of harbors, and deep water too, everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old French day&rsquo;s must have been pretty exciting hereabouts,&rdquo;
       continued Bart, making a fresh advance. &ldquo;The English and French used to
      have it hot and heavy; and I dare say this bay had its share of the fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;and before that too, long
      before; and worse goings on than fair, stand-up fights. There&rsquo;s been queer
      doings in these waters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To these words the landlord gave emphasis by a significant shake of his
      head, which spoke unutterable things, and drove Bart and Pat wild with
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord looked at him solemnly for a few moments, and then asked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever happen to hear of Captain Kidd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Kidd?&rdquo; repeated Bart, in innocent wonder, &ldquo;Captain Kidd? Hear of
      him? Of course I&rsquo;ve heard of him. Everybody knows about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if that man&rsquo;s ghost don&rsquo;t haunt this bay, then I&rsquo;m a nigger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haunt this bay? What do you mean? What had Captain Kidd to do with this
      bay? He was hanged at London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a precious lot to do with this bay,&rdquo; said the landlord,
      positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t see how that could be,&rdquo; said Bart, trying to get the
      landlord excited by contradiction. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how he ever could have
      been here. His story&rsquo;s a simple enough one; soon told. I&rsquo;ve heard it
      often. How he went from New York to London well recommended, and got a
      commission from the British government to command a ship, for the purpose
      of putting down pirates in India and the East. But this didn&rsquo;t suit him
      quite; so he turned pirate himself. Most of his piracies took place in the
      East, though. It&rsquo;s true he returned to America, and made a great panic;
      but he was captured and sent to England, where he was tried and executed.
      That was in 1699. I remember the date very well. So I don&rsquo;t see how he
      could have done much about here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bart spoke very volubly, and seemed to have the Life of Captain Kidd at
      his tongue&rsquo;s end. The landlord listened very attentively. But Bart&rsquo;s
      words, instead of shaking his own convictions, only served, as Bart had
      hoped and intended, to strengthen and confirm them. As Bart spoke, he
      raised himself up out of the lounging attitude in which he had been
      sitting, looked full in Bart&rsquo;s face, and as he ceased,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Grant all that,&rdquo; said the landlord, with a comprehensive sweep
      of his hand, which seemed to concede every single statement that Bart had
      made, in the fullest and frankest manner. &ldquo;Grant&mdash;all&mdash;that&mdash;every
      word of it. I don&rsquo;t doubt it at all&mdash;not me. Very well. Now mark me.
      Captain Kidd did really, and truly, and actually, flourish about here, in
      this here bay&mdash;for he&rsquo;s left behind him the most&mdash;un&mdash;mis&mdash;tak&mdash;able
      in&mdash;di&mdash;ca&mdash;tions. I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em myself, with my own
      eyes. I&rsquo;ve handled &lsquo;em myself, and with my own hands. And besides, that
      there pirate must have been about over the coast of America a good deal
      more than you give him credit for, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have left a name behind,
      from one end of America to the other; and, at any rate, he must have been
      here, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t have left behind what he has left, and what I&rsquo;ve
      seen with my own eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;that he had left any traces of himself here.
      What are they? What kind of traces?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of traces?&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;Traces that beat everything in
      the way of traces that any pirate ever made. What do you say, for
      instance, to a pit so deep that nobody&rsquo;s ever been able to get to the
      bottom of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pit? What sort of a pit?&rdquo; asked Bart, full of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to his filling that pit with oaken chests, crammed full
      of gold and silver ingots, and gold candlesticks, plundered from Catholic
      churches, and precious stones, such as diamonds, rubies, and emeralds&mdash;beyond
      all counting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gold! silver! precious stones!&rdquo; repeated Bart, who was so overcome by
      this astounding information, that he could only utter these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say to his taking the prisoners that had dug his hole, and
      filled it, and killing them all, to keep his secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killing his prisoners!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say,&rdquo; continued the landlord, enjoying with keenest relish
      the evident excitement of Bart,&mdash;&ldquo;what do you say to his contriving
      the most extraordinary plans ever heard of to prevent anybody ever getting
      at that treasure,&mdash;by making the hole, in the first place, far down
      under the level of the sea,&mdash;by building a drain, so as to let in the
      sea water; and then, after killing the prisoners, filling up the hole to
      the very top? What do you say to all that?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I never heard of this in all my life! How do you know it? Tell me,
      now. Tell me all about it. Where is the place? Is it here&mdash;in this
      bay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is. I&rsquo;ve said as much,&rdquo; replied the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t mention it this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, because you only wanted to hear about fine scenery. This place isn&rsquo;t
      particularly remarkable for that. It&rsquo;s a little island, not more than
      three miles from here, up that way to the right. It&rsquo;s called Oak Island,
      because Captain Kidd planted it with acorns, so as to know it when he came
      back. Well, since his day, the acorns have grown to be oaks&mdash;some of
      them pretty big&mdash;though being near the sea, they haven&rsquo;t grown so big
      as they would have done if they had been planted farther inland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oak Island!&rdquo; repeated Bart, in a tone which expressed the most profound
      interest,&mdash;&ldquo;Oak Island!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place,&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;I wonder you ain&rsquo;t heard of Oak
      Island before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;that is, I&rsquo;ve heard the name mentioned; but never
      knew that Captain Kidd had anything to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what he had,&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;Everybody in these parts
      can tell you all about it. People have been full of it ever since Chester
      was settled. I&rsquo;ve heard it all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if there&rsquo;s money there, why don&rsquo;t they get it?&rdquo; asked Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, can&rsquo;t. Captain Kidd knowed what he was about, and he made his
      arrangements so that, from that day to this, nobody&rsquo;s ever been able to
      get down to the bottom of that money-hole, and, in my humble opinion,
      never will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a long story; but as I&rsquo;ve got nothing to
      do just now, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the landlord settled himself into an easy, lounging attitude,
      and began the story of Oak Island.

      much for them.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      ||I BELIEVE.&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s always been a talk, among the
      people around here, that Captain Kidd used this place as a kind of
      headquarters; and this idea seems to me to have come down from old
      settlers who might have been here in his own day,&mdash;French and others,&mdash;though
      Chester wasn&rsquo;t actually settled till long after his time. At any rate,
      there it was, and everybody used always to believe that Captain Kidd hid
      his money somewhere in this bay. Well, nothing very particular happened
      till some sixty years ago, when a man, on visiting Oak Island, just by
      chance saw something which seemed to him very curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The island was overgrown with oaks and other trees intermixed. Now, right
      in the midst of these trees, he came to a queer-looking place. It was
      circular, and about fifteen feet in diameter. Trees grew all around it.
      Just on this circular spot, however, nothing grew at all, not even moss or
      ferns. It looked as if it had been cursed, or blasted. The trees were all
      around it&mdash;some oak and some maple; but among them was one,&mdash;pine
      or spruce, I don&rsquo;t know which,&mdash;and this one looked a good deal older
      than the others. One of the boughs of this old pine tree projected right
      over the blasted circular spot in a very singular fashion, and on this the
      man noticed something that looked like very queer growth for a pine tree.
      He climbed up, and found that it was a pulley, which was so rotten that it
      might have been hanging there a hundred years. It was fastened to the
      bough by a chain, and this was so rusty that it broke in his hands. This
      pulley and rusty chain the man removed and took with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, as you may imagine, he was a good deal struck by the
      appearance of things. He had always heard that Captain Kidd had once
      frequented Mahone Bay, and had buried treasure somewhere about; and here
      he had discovered this blasted spot with a pulley over it, in the very
      midst of the woods on a lonely island&mdash;a place that looked as though
      no one had ever been there but himself since that pulley was last used. Of
      course he asked himself what the meaning of all this was; and to him it
      seemed most likely that the circular space marked some pit in the ground,
      and that the pulley had been used to lower things down into this pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he went home, and didn&rsquo;t say anything about it to a living soul,
      except his son, a young man, whom he wanted to help him. He determined to
      examine deeper, and after talking it over with his son, he was more
      determined than ever. So the very next day they began their preparations,
      taking over picks, and spades, and ropes, and provisions, and everything
      that could be needed for their purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They went to work and dug away for a little distance, when they came to
      something hard. It was a stone hewn,&mdash;not very smooth,&mdash;a kind
      of sandstone, and on this they saw some marks that looked like strange
      letters. They were ignorant men, but they knew the alphabet, and they knew
      that this was no kind of English letters at all; but it seemed to them
      that they might be letters of some strange alphabet. They took this stone
      away, and it&rsquo;s been preserved ever since, and it&rsquo;s there yet on the
      island, built into the wall of a cottage there for safe keeping. I&rsquo;ve seen
      it myself dozens of times. That&rsquo;s what I mean when I say I&rsquo;ve seen the
      traces of Captain Kidd, for it&rsquo;s my solemn conviction that he cut that
      inscription on the stone in some foreign letters, or perhaps in some
      secret cipher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After taking out that stone, they went on digging harder than ever, and
      about two feet down they came to a sort of wooden flooring. The wood was
      in good preservation, and consisted of large logs, a dozen feet long, laid
      across side by side, and rough-hewed about six inches square. They thought
      that they had come to the money-hole now, for sure, and pulled up the logs
      quick enough, you&rsquo;d better believe; but they didn&rsquo;t know what was before
      them. After taking up the beams, they found they had to dig deeper; and so
      they went on digging away deeper and deeper. It took a long time, for they
      had to stay up the earth as they dug down, to prevent it from falling in,
      and they soon found that the job was a bigger one than they had bargained
      for; but what they had already found excited them, and cheered them on day
      after day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they couldn&rsquo;t do this all in one day. One day&rsquo;s work couldn&rsquo;t
      take them far into that hole, though they worked like beavers. Well, they
      dug on this way, and at last, about five or six feet farther down,&mdash;some
      say ten; but it don&rsquo;t make any difference,&mdash;they found another
      flooring just like the first, only the logs were smaller. These they took
      up, and then went on digging as before, day after day. They now found bits
      of things that looked favorable; they found cocoa husks, and West India
      grass, and bits of cane, all of which showed that the people who worked
      here must have had something to do with the West Indies and the Spanish
      Main. These things never grew in Nova Scotia. They had been brought here
      by the men that made the hole, and had got mixed up with the earth that
      they shovelled in. They also found shavings or chips made with tools.
      Well, about the same distance down that the second flooring had been from
      the first, they found a third flooring, which was just like the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this third flooring there was a fresh disappointment, just as there
      had been at the other two; but the very fact that there was this flooring
      encouraged them to go on, and so they continued to dig. After a time they
      came to another flooring, and continuing on, they came to another, and yet
      another; and at every place they had the same disappointment and
      encouragement. All the way they found the same signs, that the soil had
      once been turned up by people who had dealings with the Spanish Main, for
      the cocoa-nut husks and the West India grasses were mixed with the soil
      all the way. All the time they had to keep staying up the sides, and the
      deeper they went, the more careful they had to be, for the soil seemed
      loose and dangerous just here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they worked this way for about three months, and at last had got
      ever so far down&mdash;I have heard some say that they got down as much as
      a hundred feet, and that would be about seventy feet below the level of
      the sea at low tide, for the island is only a small one, and doesn&rsquo;t rise
      more than twenty-five feet at the highest point. All the way down they had
      found the signs continuing, showing that diggers had been here before, and
      that the soil had been turned up. This it was that led them on to such a
      depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now it was down at this depth that they touched the treasure. It
      was evening, and quite dark down there. They had been digging all day, and
      were about to just knock off. The son, before going, took his crowbar, and
      drove it with all his might into the ground. It was soft, loose, and
      gravelly just here, and the iron sank for about a foot into the soil, and
      struck something hard. Their attention was attracted by this at once, and
      they tried it again and again. Each time it struck something hard. It
      seemed like wood. At one or two places it seemed like metal. They tried
      this a good many times, until at length they became convinced that this
      was a wooden box with iron hoops or fastenings, and that this box
      contained the treasure for which they were searching. But by this time it
      was too late to do any more. To get at that chest would require a good
      day&rsquo;s work. To hoist it up would not be possible. They saw that they would
      have to break or cut into it as it lay, and empty it of its contents. They
      were also worn out with their long day&rsquo;s work, and in addition to this,
      they did not feel comfortable down in that particular place after dark.
      So, for all these reasons, they concluded to postpone the completion of
      their work till the following day. After all, there was no reason why they
      shouldn&rsquo;t. No one could come and take it. It would be there unmoved till
      they might want to remove it themselves. And so the long and the short of
      it is, they went up, and went off to sleep in the hut where they lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That night they slept soundly, and waked a little later than usual on the
      following day. They at once rushed to the money-hole; they did this the
      moment they waked, without waiting for breakfast, or taking anything to
      eat. They both felt anxious, for everything was at stake, and the sleep of
      both, though sound, had been marked by unpleasant and harassing dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they reached the place, and there an awful sight met them&mdash;a
      sight that meant ruination to their hopes, and to all the hard work that
      they&rsquo;d put forth in that place. The hole was gone; the earth had all
      fallen in; the stays had all given way: and there was nothing there now
      but a basin-shaped hollow, and bits of board projecting. What was worse,
      it was all mixed with water, and so soft, that in attempting to walk into
      it, they sank up to their knees in the mud. And that was the end of this
      first digging after Kidd&rsquo;s treasure; for though they tried to dig again,
      they found it impossible on account of the water. It seemed to come
      straight from the sea, and they couldn&rsquo;t do anything at all. So they had
      to give up at last, and go home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, some people think that the staying wasn&rsquo;t strong enough, and the
      sides caved in on that account; others, again, talk about Kidd&rsquo;s ghost
      baffling these diggers; but, from what was discovered afterwards, I feel
      perfectly sure that they themselves somehow let in the water of the sea
      into the hole by a drain or channel underground that Kidd himself had
      made. I think those knocks on the chest with the crowbar loosened some
      stopper, and the water poured in at once. It was this rush of sea water
      that destroyed everything, and made the hole cave in altogether. As to the
      drain, that was a contrivance of Kidd&rsquo;s to prevent the treasure from being
      dug up by outsiders. He had it made underground from the shore of the
      island at low-water mark to the bottom of the money-hole. He himself, or
      any one in the secret, would know how to dig and get the treasure; but any
      one who didn&rsquo;t know the secret would be sure to do something that would
      let in the sea water. And that&rsquo;s just what these first diggers did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after this nothing was done for a long time. These two, father and
      son, went home, and for a while they kept the whole business a secret; but
      after some years the old man died, and the son married, and so the whole
      story leaked out, till everybody knew all about it. Everybody went then to
      see the place, and the story soon got to be as well known as the alphabet
      all over the bay; and I won&rsquo;t swear but that some additions were made to
      the story as it passed from mouth to mouth, for that would only be
      natural, after all; but at any rate, that story lived, and people didn&rsquo;t
      forget the treasure on Oak Island. And so time passed, and the son died at
      last, and the grandson grew up, and this one thought that he would make a
      dash at the treasure. This was as much as forty years after the first
      digging. He went with a few friends, and they tried to dig, but couldn&rsquo;t.
      The money-hole remained as it had been left by the first diggers,&mdash;all
      sand, and gravel, and water,&mdash;more like a quicksand than anything
      else. They put a pump in it, and set it to work, but couldn&rsquo;t do anything
      that way. So they gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, these operations got known everywhere, and the whole story came up
      again. A lot of men formed themselves into a company, the grandson was one
      of them. They bought the island, and resolved to go to work on a grand
      scale. They rigged a pump which was worked by a horse in a very peculiar
      fashion, and had a hoisting apparatus worked by another horse to lift up
      the dirt. They got a lot of wood on the place for stayings to the hole,
      and went to work. Before they began, they bored down for a hundred and
      twenty feet. On taking out the auger, they saw on the lowest part scraps
      of wood, then bright scrapings that looked like gold, then wood again. And
      this showed that the auger had gone clean through the chest, and had
      brought back signs of the chest itself, and of the treasure inside. This
      created the greatest excitement, and the company went to work as eagerly
      and as industriously as the original diggers. Well, they kept at it, and
      dug, and hoisted, and pumped for a whole summer; but it was no go. As fast
      as they pumped, the water poured in, and faster too; and in fact, they
      couldn&rsquo;t make the slightest impression on the water in the money-hole, do
      what they would. So they gave up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after this, another company started. The new company bought out
      from the old all its rights, and started on a new plan. Many of the old
      company belonged to the new one, and these had learned by experience the
      impossibility of doing anything by digging in the money-hole itself. The
      new plan consisted in digging a new hole altogether. In the operations of
      the old company they had discovered that though the money-hole was all
      sand and gravel, yet all around it the soil was a hard blue clay, quite
      impervious to water, and very easy to work in. They thought by digging
      alongside the money-hole, as near as the clay would allow, they might go
      down to the same depth, and then tunnel along at the bottom till they
      reached the treasure chest. So they went to work about thirty feet away
      from the money-hole, digging in the clay. They had no trouble in digging.
      The soil was free from stones, firm clay, impervious to water, and they
      made first-rate progress to a certain extent. They got down about a
      hundred feet, and then ventured to tunnel towards the money-hole. They
      worked very carefully, for it was rather dangerous, as they were under the
      level of the sea, and were therefore exposed to a rush of water at any
      false movement that they might make. But in spite of all their care, they
      failed at last; for one day they went up to dinner, and on going back
      again, they found the new hole filled with water to within thirty feet or
      so of the top. It was a sore disappointment, and they could only console
      themselves by the thought that they had been so fortunate as to have left
      the hole at that particular time. They tried to pump out the water, and
      made some faint efforts to continue their work, but it was no use. The
      failure had been too great, and this attempt broke down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they now concluded that there was a drain, the same one I spoke of
      a while ago,&mdash;reaching from the shore of the island at low-water
      mark, or beneath it, down to the bottom of the money-hole, and that they
      had somehow broken into this drain, the waters of which had poured into
      the new hole, and flooded it. This discovery created fresh excitement: and
      as this company gave up, a new one was formed, which bought out all
      previous rights, and on the following summer proceeded to make a fresh
      attempt. Each one of these companies which had been bought out still
      retained, however, a claim on the profits that might be made; sometimes
      twenty per cent, and sometimes ten per cent, of the treasure. The new
      company, even if it had succeeded, could only have received about one
      fifth, or perhaps one fourth, of the treasure, the rest being all
      forfeited, or mortgaged, so to speak, to the old companies. Still the new
      company had many members who belonged to the old companies, and who still
      stuck to the enterprise through thick and thin, so that their undertaking,
      under such circumstances, is not so surprising, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This new company, using the experience and discoveries of the preceding
      ones, went on a new principle. The idea now was, that, first of all, the
      drain should be discovered, and the supply of water intercepted. If this
      were done, they would be able to get to the bottom of the original
      money-hole itself without any trouble. So they set to work, and explored
      the whole shore of the island. They found one place where at low tide
      there was a great bubbling in the water, and this they took for the place
      where the drain began. Here they built a coffer dam, and then tried to
      find the drain itself. On the shore they met with no success; so they dug
      pits at intervals along a line stretching from the coffer dam to the
      money-hole. The soil in all these places consisted of that same tenacious
      blue clay which I have already mentioned. I don&rsquo;t know how many of these
      were dug, but there were several, at any rate. Now, whenever they
      attempted to strike the drain, the water was invariably too much for them,
      and rushed in, giving them nothing to do but to fly as fast as they could.
      In other places they were afraid to venture too near the drain. The end of
      it was, that this last company was as unsuccessful as the others, though
      it had spent ten times as much as any of them.&rdquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      ||SO, you see,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;how all these efforts to get at the
      treasure have failed; and it is not difficult to see the reason, either.
      For, you see, as I have already said, the money-hole has been all filled
      in with sand and gravel, and there is a drain, or channel, connecting with
      the sea, which lets in the sea water; so, the moment any one undertakes to
      touch the money-hole, he has to contend with the sea itself, and there
      hasn&rsquo;t, thus far, been force enough put forth there to do that. The
      money-hole is something peculiar. All around it the soil is this blue
      clay. No doubt the soil where this was first dug was blue clay also; but,
      after burying the treasure, Kidd, for his own crafty purposes, filled it
      up with this gravel. No doubt his idea was, that the sea water should
      affect it the more thoroughly, and make it like a great quicksand. The
      pumps they set up there did no more good than if they were so many toys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the failure of the last company has been followed by a pause,
      partly on account of discouragement, but still more from the
      determination, on the part of a few, to begin again on a grand scale; on a
      scale, indeed, so grand, that it will take some time to make all the
      preparations. Some of the leaders in the previous undertakings are at the
      head of this new movement, and have already done very much towards putting
      it into life and action. This new plan is to get up a regular joint stock
      company, with a thousand shares, each worth a hundred dollars, or
      thereabouts. It will be a regular company; the shares will be sold in the
      market, and the stockholdors will stand in the same relation to this
      business as they would to a coal mine, or any other ordinary undertaking.
      They&rsquo;ll have a president, a board of directors, and a superintendent of
      the mining works. It is proposed to employ a regular engineer to survey
      the ground, and design the best mode of going to work; to put up a steam
      engine of sufficient power to pump out the money-hole, and keep a large
      force of men at work, night and day, in separate detachments. The idea is,
      to do it up as fast as possible, and get at it once for all, or fail
      utterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, this company is already started, and about a quarter of the stock
      has been taken up. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see them set to work next
      year, or the year after, at the farthest. The thing is bound to go on.
      Besides those who believe that the treasure is here, there are ever so
      many who wish to see the mystery cleared op, irrespective of any treasure.
      These men are going into the new company almost as extensively as those
      who believe in the money. Then, again, there are ever so many people about
      the country who have heard about it for the first time, and are taking
      shares just as they would buy tickets in a lottery; not because they
      expect to make anything, exactly, but because they are willing to run the
      risk, and take their chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This sort of thing, of course, has a far different prospect from what the
      old companies had. It puts the whole plan on a different footing. It makes
      it, in fact, a thoroughly legitimate business, and sets on as sound a
      basis as if it was an iron or coal mining company. A real, practical
      engineer&mdash;a man who is a practical geologist also&mdash;could tell
      more about Oak Island in one walk round it, than the other workers found
      out in years. He could find out the real place where the sea water enters;
      whether there is one only, or more than one. When once that is found out,
      and stopped, the rest is easy. But, if they can&rsquo;t stop it, why, then, let
      the steam pump go to work, and I don&rsquo;t think the money-hole would be
      flooded much longer. Then, again, the plan of having two gangs to work
      night and day, so as to have no stoppage in the operations, will be a most
      important thing. And so, what with modern science, and steam, and
      continuous work of large gangs, oven old Kidd himself &rsquo;ll find his
      match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is the gold is there&mdash;the treasure of Captain Kidd&mdash;brought
      here by him, and buried in that hole. I no more doubt that than I doubt my
      own existence. If that hole had never been touched, and people went to
      work now at the fresh ground, I believe the treasure would be got at. Why,
      the first diggers almost got it, though there were only two of them. The
      gold is there&mdash;there&rsquo;s not the slightest doubt of that&mdash;a
      treasure beyond all estimate&mdash;worth millions on millions, no doubt&mdash;gold
      and silver ingots&mdash;the plunder of Spanish cathedrals and Spanish
      galleons&mdash;diamonds and rubies&mdash;and all that. Millions? Why, it&rsquo;s
      equal in value to the revenue of a great nation. There it is; and all it
      wants is for people to go to work in the right way; not in a pettifogging,
      mean, peddling fashion, but in a large-handed, bold, vigorous way. That&rsquo;s
      the thing that &rsquo;ll fetch up the plunder of the Spanish Main! I&rsquo;ve
      sometimes heard people say that there was once a great confederacy of
      pirates that made this buy their headquarters, and that Captain Kidd was
      the last and greatest of the brotherhood. Until his time the plunder had
      been kept in a safe place, but in a place where it could be got at; but
      that he, being the last of the brotherhood, determined to fix up some
      safer place, and so he arranged this place&mdash;the hole and the drain;
      and if that&rsquo;s so, we have here not merely the plunder of Captain Kidd
      himself, but of all the pirates, for no one knows how long a time&mdash;centuries,
      I dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To all this extraordinary story the boys had listened with the deepest
      attention. The landlord&rsquo;s announcement of his own belief in it was to them
      very impressive, and his extravagant conclusion did not seem at all
      extravagant to them. It jibed perfectly with what they had heard from the
      governor of Sable Island. They were most profoundly impressed, and the
      treasure island seemed to them more attractive than ever. The landlord&rsquo;s
      mind seemed to be filled with a vision of inconceivable treasure, and by
      long familiarity with the thought, it seemed quite natural to him to speak
      so glibly about gold, and silver, and precious stones, and all the rest
      that went to make up the plunder of the Spanish Main.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart and Pat were not critical; none of the boys were. This remark has
      already been made in connection with the story of the governor of Sable
      Inland. Had they been critical, they could have picked various holes in
      this narrative, and asked questions to which it would have been difficult
      for the landlord, or any other believer in Kidd&rsquo;s treasure, to give any
      sufficient answer. They might have asked how it was that the tradition
      about the early diggers had been so minute, and why it was that no
      competent scholar or archeologist had been found who might decipher the
      inscription on the stone. They might have asked how it was that the
      so-called &ldquo;drain&rdquo; had been discovered, and also how it was that Kidd&rsquo;s
      so-called &ldquo;place&rdquo; was known so accurately. But they were not at all
      critically inclined, and the questions which they did ask were of a
      totally different kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did ask questions, of course; and the questions referred to the chief
      points in the landlord&rsquo;s story. They had much to ask about the first
      discovery, the size of the island, the appearance of the blasted circular
      spot, of the tree and the projecting bough; about the pulley and its
      chain; about the log floorings, their number, their distance apart, and
      their probable use in a money-hole; about the West Indian grass, the
      cocoa-nut husks, and the sugar-cane, which were the signs of some
      connection with the Spanish Main; about the shavings and chips of wood;
      about the gravelly soil, contrasting with the blue clay around it; about
      the eventful moment when the first diggers touched the money-box with the
      crowbar, and the destruction of their work during the night. They asked
      also, very minutely, about the stone with the inscription, its kind and
      its size, and why it should have been inserted into the chimney of a hut;
      about the drain, its size, and whether it was built of wood, or brick, or
      stone; and about the nature of the signs brought up by the anger when they
      bored through the money-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these questions showed how close had been the attention with which
      they had listened. To every one of them, without exception, the land-lord
      responded in the most unhesitating and the most comprehensive manner. It
      was evident that he had turned over every point in his mind that they now
      suggested; that he was familiar with every objection, and was armed and
      equipped at all points with facts and arguments to sustain his theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      That there were plenty of objections to that theory became evident from
      the landlord&rsquo;s own very frequent allusions to them, and it seemed, by the
      way in which he spoke of them, as though he himself had often and often
      done battle with scornful or sceptical opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my own part,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of any of these
      objections. Objections are easy enough to make. You can make them to
      anything you like&mdash;or don&rsquo;t like. The truest things in the world meet
      with lots of unbelievers, who offer objections. Now, I know this whole
      story to be true, and I don&rsquo;t value the objections a rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ono objection, for instance, is, that the story of the first diggers had
      been exaggerated in every particular. In passing from mouth to mouth, they
      say, each one has added to it, and that all the little circumstances that
      I have mentioned have been either thrown in to make up a story, or colored
      so as to favor a belief in the money-hole. Now, as to that, all I can say
      is, that the two men always told a straight story, without any additions,
      and the younger one lived down to my time, and so could easily be referred
      to by any ono. He always made the same statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great objection is, that two men could never have dug down so far, and
      stayed up the sides of the pit, as the story said they did. It has been
      asserted that they couldn&rsquo;t have dug down more than twenty or thirty feet,
      and that they probably got down that far when they came to the water,
      which prevented them from going any farther. To which I answer, not only
      that two men could have dug a hundred feet, but that they have done so,
      over and over, on the same ground, for in the holes made since, it isn&rsquo;t
      possible for more than two to work at the same time. The shafts are only
      about six feet long by three wide, and in that space there isn&rsquo;t room for
      more than two, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I find some who don&rsquo;t believe in Kidd&rsquo;s treasure, and ask them what
      could have been there, they make various answers; but the favorite one is,
      that it was some sort of a signal-station. But, unfortunately, Oak Inland
      it the last place about here that one could think of for such a purpose as
      that. Still, that is what they urge, and they say that the timber
      floorings were probably intended as a foundation. When I ask them why
      there were so many timber floorings, they quietly deny the fact They say
      that there might have been one or two such floorings, to the depth of
      perhaps ten feet, or so, but won&rsquo;t believe any more. When I point to the
      testimony of the surviving one of the first diggers, they deny the value
      of it, and say that it is only the exaggeration of an old man, who has
      been telling the same tall story for years, till it has grown to its
      present dimensions. And when people choose to argue in that style, and
      reject the best sort of evidence that there can be, why, of course,
      thero&rsquo;s no end of all discussion. They set out with a blind prejudice,
      deny plain facts, or explain them away in the most fanciful manner, and
      then turn round and ridicule those who believe in what is as plain as
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlord was silent for a moment, overcome by a kind of mild
      indignation at the sceptic of whom he spoke, after which he proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s that stone with the mysterious inscription. It&rsquo;s been seen
      by hundreds. No one has ever been found yet who can make out what it
      means. As I said before, it is either some foreign language, or else, as
      is quite probable, it is some secret cipher, known only to Kidd himself&mdash;perhaps
      used by the great pirate confederacy. It shows, more than anything else,
      that this hole was dug by Captain Kidd, and that his treasure is there.
      Now, how do you suppose they get over that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with this question the landlord looked earnestly and solemnly at the
      two boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two boys couldn&rsquo;t imagine how anybody could get over it; though Bart
      could not help wondering a little how it came that, if the inscription
      could not be deciphered, the landlord should nevertheless know so well
      that it referred to Captain Kidd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;the way they get over it. They have
      the impudence to say that it isn&rsquo;t an inscription at all. Actually,
      because no one can decipher it, they say it ain&rsquo;t an inscription. They say
      it&rsquo;s only some accidental scratches! Now, I allow,&rdquo; continued the
      landlord, &ldquo;that the marks are rather faint, and irregular; but how any man
      can look at them, and say that they&rsquo;re not an inscription&mdash;how any
      man can look at them and say that they&rsquo;re accidental scratches&mdash;is a
      thing that makes me fairly dumb with amazement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then there are other things, too,&rdquo; continued the landlord, &ldquo;which
      they handle in the same manner. One of the strangest things about this
      whole story is the fact that the soil in the money-hole is different from
      that of the rest of the island, being sand and gravel; whereas the rest of
      the island, as I told you, is blue clay. It&rsquo;s just as if a hole was dug in
      the blue clay, and then filled in with sand and gravel brought from
      somewhere else. Well, how do you think they got over this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the landlord looked inquiringly at the two buys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the two hoys gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;they get over it in the usual fashion. They say
      it isn&rsquo;t a fact that the island is blue clay, but that there&rsquo;s streaks and
      patches of gravel all over it, and the two men hit upon a place where the
      soil was sandy and gravelly. That&rsquo;s the way they get over that point; and
      I&rsquo;d like to ask any man if that&rsquo;s fair; if that&rsquo;s honest; if that&rsquo;s
      decent. Yet that&rsquo;s the way they talk&mdash;when they can go to the island,
      and see wherever fresh boles have been dug, the blue clay is turned up.
      But when I point out that, they say, &lsquo;O, that&rsquo;s because the holes are all
      dug on that one side of the island where the blue clay is.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, again, there&rsquo;s the drain,&rdquo; continued the landlord. &ldquo;Now, if any one
      thing is an established foot, next to the buried money&mdash;it&rsquo;s Kidd&rsquo;s
      drain. It&rsquo;s been broken into time after time. It&rsquo;s flooded hole after
      hole. Yet, in the face of this, they say that there isn&rsquo;t any drain at
      all; that there&rsquo;s merely some loose soil on the island, or some
      subterranean passage, made by nature, through which the sea water passes,
      and that the bottom of the so-called money-hole has been connected with
      this. Some say, that as the island is small, the sea water trickles
      through the soil, in some places, all the way across. So, of course, these
      men, shutting their eyes obstinately to hard facts, laugh at the very idea
      of a drain. And that&rsquo;s the sort of objections that we have to meet!&rdquo;
       concluded the landlord, with a snort of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is any one working on Oak Island now,&rdquo; asked Bart, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, not just now. There isn&rsquo;t a soul on the island. Since the last
      company gave up, no one has touched the works&mdash;except, occasionally,
      some visitors. Everything is standing there&mdash;the pumps, the hoisting
      tackle, and all that. You&rsquo;ll see the holes all about; and the money-hole
      can easily be known, for it is a hollow in the ground, shaped like a bowl,
      close by the largest pump, with a deep hole beside it, full of water; for,
      unfortunately, they struck the drain too soon, and of course the water
      rushed upon them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point the landlord recollected some business that he had to attend
      to, and rising to his feet, he slowly sauntered away.

      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE landlord&rsquo;s story had
      produced a very profound impression upon the minds of the boys, and the
      reiterated emphasis which he placed upon the treasure supposed to be
      buried there did not fail to kindle their imaginations to a wonderful
      degree. But together with this excitement, and astonishment at the
      magnitude of the supposed treasure, there were also other feelings, which
      latter tended to repel them as much as the former tended to attract them.
      These feelings consisted of discouragement and disappointment, at learning
      the insuportable difficulties that lay in in the way, and at hearing the
      story of repeated failures. Efforts had been made, as they now know, far
      greater than any which were possible to their feeble arms; and in every
      case the money diggers, whether digging in person or by deputy, had failed
      utterly and miserably, each one only learning of some new difficulty which
      necessitated still more arduous toils. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      As the landlord strolled off, Bart and Pat moved away also up the hill
      towards the back part of the town; and here they sat on a secluded grassy
      slope, looking down into the back bay, whose blue waters lay at their
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it&rsquo;s a great thing entirely, so it is,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;an that&rsquo;s all
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t any idea,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;that people knew so much about it I
      didn&rsquo;t imagine that any body had tried to dig there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it&rsquo;s natural enough for them to do that same, if they thought
      there was money in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was, an that&rsquo;s the very thing we haven&rsquo;t been taking into
      account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, an that same&rsquo;s true for you, thin; niver a bit did we take it into
      account. Haven&rsquo;t we been making a wonderful secret of it, when all the
      wurruld knows it like A, B, C.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and what&rsquo;s worse, at this very moment they are sending out agents in
      all directions, all over the province, I dare say, to try to get people to
      take stock in the new mining company. Why, every body must know all about
      Oak Inland. I don&rsquo;t see how we never heard of it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deed, thin, an I think they must have kept it all to thimselves here in
      Cheater, so I do, or else we&rsquo;d have heard some talk about it at school, so
      we would; an if there&rsquo;s any talk about it now through the country, it&rsquo;s
      something new entirely, so it is, and is the doin of this new company,
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what we can do,&rdquo; said Bart, in a dejected tone; &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t do
      a single thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, thin,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s meself that&rsquo;s boon thinkin different; an
      I don&rsquo;t know now but what the chances for us are better thin they were
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chances for us better? What in the world do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked
      Bart, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it&rsquo;s plain enough. Ye see that treasure was a hundred feet an
      more under ground, an so it was clane beyond anything that we could do But
      these companies have been a workin, an a diggin, an a pumpin, an a borin
      holes all about, an we&rsquo;ve got that much of the work done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but what good &rsquo;ll that do us? These holes weren&rsquo;t any good to
      the companies. They couldn&rsquo;t get to the money-hole, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, but sure an may be they didn&rsquo;t go to work the right way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I dare say they did all that could be done; and I don&rsquo;t see how
      anybody could do any more, except they get a steam engine, the way they &rsquo;re
      going to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, sure an that&rsquo;s all very well; but still, whin the holes ere already
      bored, the hardest of the work&rsquo;s done; an a handy boy might be more use
      than a stame ingin, so he might. Sore an I&rsquo;d like to see meself at the
      bottom of one of thim pits that&rsquo;s nearest to the money-hole. I&rsquo;d make a
      grab for the trisure, so I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh, nonsense! What could you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;d make a dash for it. There&rsquo;s nothin like tryin. Nothin venture,
      nothin have. I&rsquo;ve got a notion that a body might make a bit of a tunnel in
      undor there, an git at the money-box. At any rate it&rsquo;s worth tryin for, so
      it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tunnol!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart &ldquo;I never thought of that Do you really think
      that you could do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Pat &ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;ve seen it done. All ye&rsquo;ve got to do is to
      have on archway, an there it is. It&rsquo;ll howld till doomsday. A tunnol is
      it? Sure I&rsquo;d like to see meself down there with a bit of a pick, an I&rsquo;d
      soon have the tunnel. An besides, it&rsquo;s only blue clay I&rsquo;d have to work
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Burt, in great excitement &ldquo;He said blue clay. It&rsquo;s only
      in the money-hole where the sand and gravel are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An blue clay,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;to my mind, is as aisy cuttin as chalk or
      chaise. It&rsquo;s like cuttin into butther, so it is. Why, there&rsquo;s nothin in
      the wide wurrld to hender you an me from goin down there an tannelin
      through the blue day from the nearest pit straight into the money-hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what can we do about the water rushing in?&rdquo; asked Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an we can only try,&rdquo; said Pat &ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t kape the water out, well
      give up. But we may work along so as to kape clear of the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can we do that?&rdquo; asked Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it?&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;Sure an what&rsquo;s to hender us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other workmen couldn&rsquo;t, you know,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;an you don&rsquo;t, either. How do we know that
      they ever tried? They dug the pits to try and stop the drain; that&rsquo;s what
      they tried to do. But we&rsquo;re a goin to try to tunnel into the money-hole;
      an there&rsquo;s all the difference in the wurruld between the two, so there is.
      Besides, there&rsquo;s no harrum in tryin. If we can&rsquo;t do it we can come back,
      an no harrum done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we tell the other follows?&rdquo; said Bart, after a thoughtful pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorra a one of them,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;Tell them, is it? Not me. What for? Sure
      only two can work in a hole at a time, an that&rsquo;s me an you; an what do we
      wont of any more? We&rsquo;ll tell them after we&rsquo;ve got the trisure; and thin
      we&rsquo;ll all go halves all around, so we will; only well have the glory of
      gettin it, an no harruum done to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t a bad idea,&rdquo; said Bart, thoughtfully. &ldquo;The other fellows
      needn&rsquo;t know. They haven&rsquo;t heard the story, and perhaps won&rsquo;t hear it; at
      any rate, not before to-morrow; and it&rsquo;s a crazy sort of an undertaking,
      and mayn&rsquo;t amount to anything; so, as you say, Pat, it may be best for us
      to start off, us two, on our own hooks, and investigate. My idea is, for
      us to get off there in a quiet way, land on Oak Island, and look around to
      see if any of the holes are suitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shuitable!&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;Sure they&rsquo;ll all shuit, so they will, if they
      ain&rsquo;t full of water. All we want is, a impty pit, within aisy an
      accissible distance of the money-hole for us to tunnel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll have to find out first. But when can we go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;airly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re going to Aspotogon,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an we may slip off an let the others go by thimselves. We&rsquo;ll go to
      Oak Island at four in the morrnin, an &rsquo;ll be back by nine or tin&mdash;about
      the time when they&rsquo;re startin. If they wait for us, all right; we may go
      with them there or not, just as it shuits us; that depinds on the
      prospects at Oak Island. But if they don&rsquo;t wait for us it won&rsquo;t make any
      difference in the wurruld, so it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some further conversation, the two boys resolved to carry out this
      proposal. They thought they could easily leave the hotel on the following
      morning, at the earliest light, and then go off to explore Oak Island by
      themselves. The others would not probably start for Aspotogon before nine
      or ten. If they found Oak Island affording no prospect of success in their
      plan, they could easily return to Chester, in time to start for Aspotogon
      with the others; while if, on the other hand, they did see any chance to
      make Pat&rsquo;s tunnel, they could remain there and go to work. The others
      would probably think they had gone fishing, and set off without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposal of Pat was a wild and impracticable one, but to Bart it
      seemed easy enough. The thing that had influenced him most was the idea of
      a &ldquo;tunnel,&rdquo; of which Pat spoke so knowingly. Without having any very
      distinct conception of the difficulties in the way of a &ldquo;tunnel,&rdquo; he
      allowed himself to be fascinated by the very mention of it, and so flung
      himself headlong into the scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their determination to keep this plan a secret from the others, did not,
      of course, arise out of any desire to forestall them, or to seize for
      themselves the treasure which they supposed to be on the island. It was
      rather the design of achieving some exploit which should astonish their
      friends. It was glory, not covetousness, that animated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this frame of mind, then, and with this purpose, they returned to the
      inn. Nothing was said about Oak Island. The landlord himself did not refer
      to it. Perhaps he had talked enough about it for one day, and was tired of
      it; or perhaps he was merely husbanding his resources, so as to tell it
      with full effect on the following day to those of the party who had not
      yet heard it; for when a man has a good story, and meets with a perfectly
      fresh crowd of hearers, he naturally feels unwilling to throw the story
      away, and prefers to toll it under the best possible circumstances. That
      evening they talked chiefly about the expedition to Aspotogon. Bruce,
      Arthur, Tom, and Phil did the talking. Bart and Pat were comparatively
      silent. The first four said nothing, however, about the buccaneers, for
      they, like the landlord, were reserving this subject for the following
      day. They also had all conceived the idea that Aspotogon was the very
      place where the treasure of the buccaneers might be buried; and this, of
      course, threw additional attractions around the proposed trip. The name
      seemed suitable to such a deed. It was sonorous and impressive; and to
      them it seemed to suggest all sorts of possible crimes and tragedies. Deep
      Cove, also, was a name not without its significance; and they fancied in
      this place they might find the hiding-place of the old pirates of which
      the governor of Sable Island had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before retiring, they decided that they would not start till nine o&rsquo;clock,
      which hour would be most convenient for all, especially the landlord, who
      protested against getting out of bed at any unusually early hour. With
      this understanding they all retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Bart and Pat were awake and up before the dawn. Dressing themselves
      hastily, they quitted the house as noiselessly as possible, and went off
      to the promenade or square, at the end of the town. Here a number of boats
      were drawn up on the beach. At that early hour it was impossible to find
      any owner; nor did Bart or Pat feel inclined to stand on any ceremony.
      They selected the best of them, and thought that on their return they
      might apologize to the owner, whoever he might turn out to be, and pay him
      for the use of the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question now was, how to find Oak Island. That the island was
      somewhere in the bay on this side of Chester they knew from what the
      landlord had told them, but which particular one it might be among the
      hundreds of the bay they could not imagine. The knowledge that it was
      covered with oaks, was the only guide they had; and with this they set
      forth, hoping to find the object of their search. There was a sail in the
      boat, and a pair of oars, and a gentle breeze was blowing; so they hoisted
      the sail, and slipped at a very good pace over the water. On their way
      they passed several islands. One of these had farm-houses on it; another
      had no houses at all; but still they saw nothing of those oak trees, and
      frames, and pumps, and other engines which marked Oak Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      They kept on; however, sailing past some islands, and around others, until
      more than an hour had passed, and they both concluded that it would be far
      better to go ashore somewhere and ask directions. They saw a house not far
      away on the main land, and at once sailed in this direction. The wind
      still continued very moderate, and though neither Bart nor Pat knew much
      about navigating a boat, they managed to get along in this breeze without
      any trouble whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      On landing, Pat remained in the boat, while Bart went to the house just
      mentioned. On his way he crossed the high road which here runs along the
      shore, winding beautifully around every curve and inlet as it encircles
      the bay. Bart had some difficulty in rousing the people, for it was yet
      very early in the morning, and they were all sound asleep. At last,
      however, he heard sounds of movement inside, and then a man appeared, half
      dressed, and rubbing his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Bart, pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morn&rsquo;n, said the man, with a yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me where I can find Oak Island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oak Island?&rdquo; repeated the man, stretching himself with another yawn and
      looking at Bart,&mdash;&ldquo;Oak Island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;Oak Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you ain&rsquo;t a tryin to walk there, surely!&rdquo; said the man, in some
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my boat just down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Wal, Oak Island&rsquo;s jest over there;&rdquo; and he pointed up
      the bay farther, in a direction which Bart had not taken at all. &ldquo;You go
      straight up about two miles from here, an you&rsquo;ll hit it. You can&rsquo;t mistake
      it. It&rsquo;s a little island with some oak trees and some stagins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one there now, I suppose,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;not
      jest now. They&rsquo;ve knocked off,&mdash;the last batch did,&mdash;and there
      ain&rsquo;t likely to be no more till the next lot of fools turns up that&rsquo;s got
      more money than brains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From which remark Bart gathered that the man was an unbeliever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to believe in Kidd&rsquo;s treasure,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin to say that; but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I
      don&rsquo;t believe in. I don&rsquo;t believe in people a throwin of their money away
      into the airth an into the sea when they might be doin better with it.
      Yes, a throwin of it away, tryin to get at a money-box that&rsquo;s out of the
      power of man to touch. Yes, sir; flesh and blood won&rsquo;t never lay hands on
      Kidd&rsquo;s treasure&mdash;leastways not unless there&rsquo;s a sacrifice made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sacrifice!&rdquo; repeated Bart, in amazement. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an
      old sayin hereabouts, as to the fact as that that thar treasure bein
      buried there with the sacrifice of human life, is laid under a cuss, and
      the cuss can&rsquo;t ever be lifted, nor the money-box either, till some of the
      diggers kills a man. That&rsquo;s the old sayin; an mind you, it&rsquo;ll have to come
      to that. Blood must be shed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man uttered these last words in a deep tone, that suggested all sorts
      of superstitious horrors; and from the tenor of these last remarks, Bart
      perceived that this man, far from being an unbeliever, as he had at first
      supposed, was one of the firmest possible believers, and surrounded his
      belief with the accompaniments of the darkest superstition. To Bart this
      only served to intensify the interest which he already felt in Oak Island;
      for he saw that the people of the neighborhood were the firmest believers
      in the existence of the treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few more questions followed, referring chiefly to the appearance of the
      island; and having at length gathered all the information that he wanted,
      Bart returned to the boat, and once more the two boys proceeded on their
      way. The place towards which the man had pointed was straight before them,
      and every little while grew more and more plainly defined against the line
      of land beyond, until at length they could see that it was an island.
      Nearer and nearer they drew, and gradually they saw the oak trees, which
      differed from the trees of the other islands. The trees stood apart more
      like a grove planted by man than a forest of nature&rsquo;s planting. Other
      signs soon appeared; a rough hut, some stagings in different places, of
      peculiar construction, and here and there mounds of earth. There could be
      no doubt about it. This was the place which they sought. This was the home
      of the buccaneers; the haunt of Captain Kidd; the place where lay buried
      far down in the earth, and far beneath the sea, the plunder of the Spanish
      Main!

       style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE bows of the boat grated on the
      pebbled beach, and Bart and Pat stepped ashore. On landing, their first
      thought was to secure the boat. This was not a difficult task. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Close by them was a tree, growing near the beach, and all that they had to
      do was to draw the boat up for a short distance, and fasten a line around
      the tree. After this, they stood by the boat for a little while, and
      looked at the island upon which they had landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was small, not over a quarter of a mile across, and rose gently from
      the sea to a height of not more than thirty feet. Oak trees, planted at
      considerable intervals, grew over the surface, none of them being of any
      very great size. Under these there was, in some places, a thick turf,
      which looked as though the ground had once been cultivated, and had run
      out, while in other places it was rough, and rose in those mossy mounds or
      cradles which characterize soil that has been cleared, but has never been
      subject to cultivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they stood here and looked at the scene before them, they saw, not very
      far away, a mound of earth. They had seen this from the boat as they
      approached, and had at once thought that it might be the very ground
      removed from the earth in forming one of the numerous pits. In digging
      these pits the earth would be raised, and thrown on one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure that&rsquo;s what I towld ye,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;Ye know there must be a deep
      hole from the height of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;There must be a hole there. Come, let&rsquo;s have a look at
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words the two started forward, and walked towards the heap of
      earth. As they came up, they noticed that the soil consisted of clay of a
      dull bluish tinge, like pale slate, and they recognized at once the bluish
      clay of which the landlord had spoken. The heap of earth was of
      considerable dimensions. They both walked up it, and on reaching the top,
      they saw on the other side an opening in the ground. Hurrying down towards
      it, they recognized in it at once one of those pits made by some one of
      the companies digging here. The mouth of it was about six feet long and
      four feet wide. The sides were stayed up by planks. They could not see far
      down, however, for the pit contained water, which came to within a dozen
      feet of the surface. How deep the pit was they could not see; but they at
      once conjectured that this was one of those pits mentioned by the
      landlord, where the diggers in search of the &ldquo;drain&rdquo; had broken into it,
      and had thus been compelled to fly from the waters that poured in upon
      them. This pit was flooded (as the landlord had said) from &ldquo;Kidd&rsquo;s drain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After examining this pit, they proceeded farther, and saw another mound
      not far away. It was just like this, of about the same dimensions, and
      consisting of the same bluish clay. To this they directed their steps,
      knowing now that another pit might be expected here, and in this
      expectation they were not disappointed. There was a pit here of precisely
      the same appearance as the one which they had just examined, stayed up in
      the same way around the sides by stout planks, and of about the same size.
      Like the other, it was also full of water. Here too, then, as they
      thought, the diggers had broken into the &ldquo;drain,&rdquo; and had flooded the pit.
      The occurrence of these two pits, both full of water, showed them, in a
      very striking and very significant manner, the difficulties that those
      encountered who sought to penetrate to the hidden treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the boys were curious to see some pit that might not be full of water,
      so as to see with their own eyes the depth of these excavations. The
      landlord had mentioned a hundred feet. Such a depth as that, they knew,
      exceeded the height of an ordinary church spire, and they both wondered
      whether it would be possible for them to descend. They, therefore, turned
      away from this pit after a slight examination, and looked around for
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several mounds appeared not very far away, and they at once went off to
      the nearest of these. Here, then, was a pit which was also flooded. The
      sight of this third pit, full of water, made them fear that this was the
      condition of all of them, and their discouragement was consequently great;
      however, they had not yet examined all, and two or three other mounds yet
      remained to be visited. They went on, therefore, to the next; and here, on
      reaching the pit which adjoined it, they found, to their great delight,
      that it was dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dry and deep. The hundred feet which the landlord had spoken of seemed to
      be a moderate estimate for this pit. Its length and width at the mouth
      were the same as those of the others; and the staying of the sides with
      stout planks was the same. On looking down, they could see no bottom. Bart
      took a stone and dropped it, and the time which was taken up in the fall
      to the bottom seemed to fully warrant the estimate above mentioned. But
      such a pit as this did not appear to offer much chance of descending into
      it. None of the pulleys or windlasses which must once have been used here
      to lower the workmen, or hoist up the earth, now remained. The planks used
      as staying were over an inch apart, and these offered occasional spaces
      which might possibly be used as a foothold. Still, to climb down here
      without some sort of a rope was not to be thought of, and though Bart and
      Pat were both excellent climbers, they both saw at once that this was a
      task beyond their powers. And they had not brought a rope with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On looking around once more, they saw at no very great distance a staging,
      which at once reminded them of the directions given them by the man on the
      shore, and also of the words of the landlord. This staging they had also
      noticed as they approached the island in the boat. They now set out for
      this, and reached it in a short time. This staging was about the highest
      point on the island, and was in the midst of an immense collection of
      mounds of earth, and sand, and blue clay. As they stood here, they could
      see several pits around them; but their attention was at once arrested by
      one place close by the staging. It was a hollow in the earth, shaped like
      a bowl, about twenty feet in diameter, and perhaps the same depth. At once
      the landlord&rsquo;s description of the present appearance of the &ldquo;money-hole&rdquo;
       flashed across their memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, must be the place,&mdash;this bowl-shaped hollow. There could
      be no doubt about it. This must be the spot chosen by the buccaneers for
      that pit in which they were to hide their treasure. Here beneath,&mdash;far
      beneath,&mdash;lay concealed the plunder of the Spanish Main. Here was
      that blasted circular spot, with the blighted tree, and the decayed
      pulley, which had revealed the secret to the first diggers. Here those two
      had worked who had so nearly reached the treasure, and this bowl-shaped
      cavity showed them what appeared to the eyes of those first diggers, when,
      after they had just touched the treasure, they went forth on the following
      morning to see their labor destroyed, and all their toil wasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around this were the signs of other labors, and the unmistakable traces of
      all the toilers, who in succession had labored here. Some pits had caved
      in, like the original &ldquo;money-hole.&rdquo; Others had filled with water. The
      sand, gravel, and clay, that had been drawn up out of these various
      excavations, covered a large space. Close by a pit, which lay nearest to
      the &ldquo;money-hole,&rdquo; rose the staging which had attracted them. On examining
      this, its purpose was at once evident. It was erected so as to allow of
      the working of pumps by horse-power. The circle was there which the horses
      traversed, and all the machinery was in perfect order. They understood the
      purpose of this machine at once from the landlord&rsquo;s story. It had been
      intended to reach the bottom of the &ldquo;money-hole&rdquo; by a new pit, and this
      pit was to be kept dry by pumping. The pit must evidently be the one which
      immediately adjoined the &ldquo;money-hole.&rdquo; But how completely this plan had
      failed, was now evident to them from this pit itself, which, like the
      others that they had first seen, was full of water. This pit had proved of
      no avail against &ldquo;Kidd&rsquo;s drain.&rdquo; Horse-power had been weak against the
      tides of the sea. Here was the melancholy result&mdash;a failure complete
      and utter; a pit flooded; engines useless; costly works deserted. Would
      the attempt ever be made again? or if so, would steam succeed when pitted
      against the waters of the ocean?
    </p>
    <p>
      They went down into the bowl-shaped cavity which marked the &ldquo;money-hole,&rdquo;&mdash;they
      did so cautiously, for they had vague fears of quicksand. But their fears
      were idle. The ground seemed as hard and as solid as on any other part of
      the island. They stood there, and stamped, and jumped, but the firm soil
      yielded not. They could scarcely believe that this was the very central
      point affected by the waters of the sea. And yet this must be so, for this
      was the point to which the &ldquo;drain&rdquo; had been directed, and far down the
      waters guarded the treasure from the hand of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      After remaining here for a time, they emerged from the cavity, and their
      attention was next attracted by a hut not far away. To this they directed
      their steps. They found the door wide open, and entered. Inside they saw
      two rooms divided by a board partition, with a chimney rising in the
      middle. This had been the place where the workmen lived, for signs of
      these occupants were still visible around. The two rooms were filled with
      spades, and chains, and boxes, and a miscellaneous collection of articles
      that had probably been used by the last excavators, and had been left here
      in anticipation of further use. Among these they saw a quantity of ropes
      in coils of different sizes; and they saw at once that if they wished to
      go down into any one of the pits, a way of descending was now supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chimney at once suggested to their minds the remarks of the landlord
      about the stone with the inscription. To the boys that stone seemed the
      most important part of the whole story, and offered a more direct evidence
      as to its truth than anything else. They wished to see it, and judge for
      themselves. They accordingly examined the chimney on every side, but, to
      their very great disappointment, could not see anything of the kind. At
      length Bart found a place in the chimney from which a portion seemed to
      have been detached, and he at once declared that this must have been the
      place where the stone was, and that it had probably been taken away, so as
      to be made use of for the purpose of affecting the public mind, and
      inducing people to take stock in the new company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the ropes at once awakened within them a desire to put in
      practice their intention of descending into one of the pits. It did not
      seem to them to be dangerous. Bart was as active as a cat in climbing,
      especially when he had anything to do with ropes; while Pat, though not
      equal to him in this respect, was still quite able to do any ordinary work
      of the kind. One of the pits, as they had seen, was dry, but it was a
      little too far away. They wished to find one which was rather nearer the
      &ldquo;money-hole,&rdquo; where there might be some chance of putting into practice
      Pat&rsquo;s idea about the tunnel. No thought of danger entered into their
      minds, no dread of the treacherous waters which had broken through into
      the other holes, and flooded them. They prepared to put their scheme into
      execution as calmly as if it was no more than climbing a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      But first they must seek a pit nearer the &ldquo;money-hole;&rdquo; and with this
      intention they went back to that central spot, where they examined the
      pits in its neighborhood. To their great joy they soon found one. It was
      on the side opposite to that where the staging had been erected, and was
      quite dry. This they knew by dropping stones down, and listening to the
      sound made when they struck. All of them fell with a dull thud, and
      without any splashing noise, such as would have been produced had water
      been there.
    </p>
    <p>
      This at once decided them in favor of the pit just mentioned: and the next
      thing was, how to arrange the rope so as to make the descent. One could
      not lower the other; and if such a thing had been possible, neither one
      would have been willing to stay up. There was therefore nothing for them
      to do but to adopt the simple plan of climbing down by means of a rope
      secured to the top. First of all they had to select the rope. This they
      did without much delay. Among the various coils in the hut, one seemed
      suitable from size and quality. It had been used, like all the others; it
      seemed perfectly strong enough; and it was also sufficiently soft and
      smooth to the hands. This coil was therefore selected and brought to the
      place. A stone was quickly attached to one end, and was thrown down. The
      rope fell all the way to the bottom without being more than half expended.
      The rest of the coil lay at the edge of the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now how were they to secure this, so as to descend? Something was
      needed which might bear their weight. At first they thought of tying the
      upper part of the rope to one of the planks which formed the staying of
      the sides of the pit; but this did not seem strong enough. They then went
      off to hunt up something. In the house there was a crowbar, which was
      strong enough, yet not long enough, to satisfy them. But outside of the
      house there was a large beam, fully twelve feet long and eight inches
      thick. This seemed to be the very thing. It was apparently sound and
      strong, and, as far as they could see, was quite able to support ten times
      the weight to which it would be subjected. This beam therefore was chosen
      without the slightest hesitation, and Bart and Pat, taking it up in their
      arms, carried it to the mouth of the pit; then they laid it across, and
      tied the rope about it as securely as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      All now seemed perfectly safe, and nothing remained but to make the
      descent. Bart went first. The planks used for staying around the sides of
      the pit were far enough apart to offer here and there interstices in which
      the feet might be inserted, though in many of these places the earth
      bulged through so as to prevent a foothold. They thus afforded assistance;
      and Bart, as he began his descent, availed himself of it. As he went down,
      Pat watched him anxiously from above. Before his head had disappeared, he
      said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, by the way, Pat! throw down that pickaxe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Pat had brought a pickaxe from the hut, in order to make his tunnel;
      and it was now lying on the ground, close by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, but I was goin to wait till you got down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! and throw it on my head! No, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an I niver thought of that at all at all,&rdquo; said Pat; &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s lucky
      for you that you thought of it just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words Pat dropped the pickaxe into the pit, and it fell with a
      dull thud far down at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart now continued his descent, and Pat watched him all the way. At length
      a voice came up from far below,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! Come along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this Pat descended, and went down cautiously and carefully, clinging
      with feet and hands to the rope and to the sides of the pit. He was not so
      dexterous as Bart, and once or twice he lost his foothold on the side of
      the pit, and slid for several feet, the rope cutting his hands; but still
      he kept on, for Bart was waiting for him, and encouraging him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, when about thirty feet from the bottom, where Bart was
      standing, he found a place where he could stick his foot, and waited for a
      moment to look down through the darkness. He could see nothing. As he
      looked, his foot slipped from the place, and he fell with a jerk, the rope
      sliding painfully through his chafed hands. At that very instant it seemed
      to him that the rope itself was falling. From above there came a dull
      creaking sound, and from below a cry of horror burst from Bart. At that
      instant, Pat&rsquo;s feet touched the bottom of the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart grasped his arm convulsively, and pointed upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beam! the beam!&rdquo; he almost screamed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s broke. O, what shall we
      do!&rdquo;
     </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Pat looked up; and there, clearly defined against the sky, he saw the beam
      around which the rope was fastened, no longer lying straight across the
      mouth of the pit, but sagging down in the middle at a sharp angle. It had
      been rotten in the middle. It had cracked at that last jerk occasioned by
      his fall from his foothold; and it now hung broken midway, still clinging
      together by a few fibres, but suspended there above them, like the sword
      of Damocles, as if by a single hair, and threatening every instant to fall
      and crush them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rope and the beam had both been rotten, and the jerk which had been
      given when Pat lost his foothold had cracked the one and broken the other.
      There, about thirty feet above them, hung the end of the rope where it had
      parted. The rest of it was still in Pat&rsquo;s hands.

       style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE other boys rose that morning at the
      usual hour, and descended leisurely to breakfast. The absence of Bart and
      Pat was noticed and commented on. It was supposed, however, that they had
      gone off somewhere to get up an appetite for breakfast, and that they
      would be along before the meal was over. Time passed, and the breakfast
      was ended; but still no signs appeared of the absentees. It was now nearly
      time to start, and they all strolled down to the wharf where the Antelope
      was, thinking that the two boys might possibly be there. On reaching the
      place they looked around, but saw no signs of them. Captain Corbet had not
      seen them, nor had Solomon. Everything was ready, and it was only a few
      minutes of the time. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer where those fellows can have gone to,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone on a walk, of course,&rdquo; said Arthur; &ldquo;and I dare say they&rsquo;ve
      gone farther than they intended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, they&rsquo;ll be along soon,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;and won&rsquo;t they be half starved?
      Methinks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange thing,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;that they should have slipped off in
      this way. No one knows anything about them. No one at the inn saw them go
      out. They must have got up precious early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re both rather early risers,&rdquo; said Arthur; &ldquo;and they may have
      gone off fishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say they have,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;Bart is crazy about fishing, and if
      he has got one solitary bite, he&rsquo;ll give up the expedition to Aspotogon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Pat&rsquo;s as bad, every bit,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;Depend upon it, those two have
      gone out to catch fish for breakfast, and won&rsquo;t be back till somewhere
      about evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if they&rsquo;ve both backed out
      deliberately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Backed out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I don&rsquo;t believe they cared about going to Aspotogon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! nonsense! What makes you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, last evening I noticed that they didn&rsquo;t say a single word. Both of
      those fellows were as muni as mice, and all the rest of us were in full
      cry about the expedition. Depend upon it, they didn&rsquo;t want to go, and have
      backed out. They didn&rsquo;t want to say anything about it, for fear we&rsquo;d tease
      them to come, but quietly dropped off, leaving us to go without them. O,
      that&rsquo;s the way, beyond a doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that you mention it, Tom,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;I do remember that they didn&rsquo;t
      say anything last night, neither of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did they,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pact,&rdquo; said Bruce; &ldquo;it looks very much as if they had talked the matter
      over, and concluded to back out in this quiet way; and I don&rsquo;t know but
      what they have concocted some scheme of their own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, some fishing scheme, of course. Bart was crazy about it, you know, and
      he&rsquo;s persuaded Pat to go with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in that case we needn&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we may as well hang on till ten&mdash;in case they should turn up
      after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the opinion, then, to which the other boys came, about the
      disappearance of Bart and Pat. It was a perfectly natural one under the
      circumstances. Bart and Pat were distinguished above all things for their
      fondness for fishing; their silence during the conversation of the
      preceding evening really made it seem as though they had no desire to go
      to Aspotogon, but had some plan of their own. This plan seemed to the boys
      to be undoubtedly a fishing expedition. There was, therefore, not the
      slightest feeling of uneasiness in the mind of any of them, nor did even
      Captain Corbet, who had listened to the conversation, imagine that there
      was any cause for alarm. To have imagined danger to them in such a place
      as this, on dry ground, in a civilized country, was out of the question.
      Notwithstanding this conviction, they thought it possible, however, that
      the two might yet return in time, and therefore they decided to wait for
      them till ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation about Bart and Pat was suddenly interrupted by the
      appearance of the landlord, who brought them another disappointment. He
      told them that important business had most unexpectedly required him to go
      up the country for twenty miles or so, and that he should not be able to
      accompany them. He expressed the greatest possible regret, and the boys
      expressed still more. They at once offered to postpone their expedition
      till the following day; but the landlord was not certain whether he should
      be back by that time or not, and advised them to go without him. He said a
      friend of his would go, who knew the whole country, and could tell them
      all that they wanted to know about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great was the disappointment of the boys at this unexpected occurrence.
      They had particularly wished to have the landlord&rsquo;s company, for reasons
      already stated. He was so genial, so communicative, and so destitute of
      inquisitiveness, that he seemed the very man whom they might be able to
      pump to their hearts&rsquo; content, without making their purpose apparent to
      him. One great charm of the expedition lay in their belief that Aspotogon
      and Deep Cove had been the haunts of the buccaneers, and that the landlord
      would show them the traditionary place where the treasure had been
      deposited. They did not think that another man could supply his place; and
      when, shortly after, the landlord brought his friend along, they were sure
      of it. For the friend, whose name the landlord gave as Turnbull, was a
      heavy, dull-looking man, and the last in the world whom they would have
      chosen in the landlord&rsquo;s place. However, there was no help for it. It was
      useless to postpone it, and, consequently, at ten o&rsquo;clock the Antelope
      started on her voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      On emerging from the little harbor of Chester into the bay, the scene that
      presented itself was beautiful in the extreme. Much of it was familiar to
      their eyes, owing to their previous cruise about the bay on the first day
      of their arrival; but they now saw it under a somewhat different aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one side arose an island, bare of trees, and covered with grass, of no
      great size, but conspicuous from its position. In its neighborhood were
      other islands, some all wooded from the shore to the summit, others
      showing green meadows peeping forth from encircling foliage. Before them
      spread the shores of Tancook, all green with verdure, dotted with white
      houses, and showing, here and there, the darker hue of forest trees, amid
      the green, grassy meadows. Beyond this, and far out to sea, was Ironbound,
      which, from this distance, looked dark and repellent. It was more wooded
      than the other islands, and did not seem popular as a dwelling-place.
      Naturally so, for at that distance out, it was exposed to the storms and
      the fogs of the ocean, while those islands within the bay were in the
      possession of a far more genial soil and climate. On the left, the
      coast-line ran on beyond a neighboring point, till it terminated in a
      distant headland; and here, on that line of coast, several miles this side
      of the headland, the land arose to a wooded eminence, which was no other
      than the very place which they were seeking&mdash;Aspotogon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys were disappointed, for they had expected something much higher.
      It did not seem to them to be more than a very ordinary hill, nor did it
      rise very high above the level of the surrounding land. Still, they were
      willing to be pleased, and therefore tried to think that it might really
      be much higher than it seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line of coast ran on, showing cleared fields along the shore, which,
      farther back, were succeeded by wooded slopes. In this line of shore there
      did not appear the slightest opening, nor could they imagine how it was
      possible for a schooner to reach the base of Aspotogon. That there was a
      passage, however, they were again and again assured by Turnbull, who,
      though not at all inclined to give any information, was yet capable of
      answering direct questions, and telling the names of places. The existence
      of a cove, or strait, in such a place, where there seemed nothing but an
      unbroken line of coast, gave additional strength to that fancy in which
      the boys had already been indulging, and made them think that this place,
      so completely hidden, must be, above all others, the place once chosen as
      a secure retreat by the buccaneers. This feeling gained strength as they
      went on. The distance was not far. The wind was fair. The Antelope did her
      best, and so they gradually drew nearer and nearer. Still, no sign
      appeared of any opening, nor could they make out any place where an
      opening might be likely to be found. At last Turnbull remarked that this
      was the place, and that the Antelope would have to anchor here, as it
      would be inconvenient, in this wind, to get out of Deep Cove if they were
      to enter it in the schooner. Down went the Antelope&rsquo;s anchor, and the boat
      was hauled up alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were not more than a quarter of a mile from the shore. Deep Cove was
      there,&mdash;for so Turnbull said,&mdash;and they were about to visit it,
      yet there was still no more appearance of any opening than before. The
      shore seemed to run on without any break, and the boys sought in vain to
      find some place into which a boat might go; but the boat was ready, and
      this mystery was soon to be solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drew very near to the shore before the long-sought-for opening
      appeared. The opening was at such an angle that it could not be detected
      from the direction in which they had approached, and the curve made by the
      cove was of such a kind that it was difficult to detect it from any
      direction. On entering it they saw that it was deep and spacious, with the
      shore on one side covered with forest trees, and on the other side
      cleared. Rowing on a little farther, the cove curved, and the cleared land
      was left behind. Now a scene of grandeur appeared. The cove ran between
      lofty heights, which bordered it, now with precipitous rocky cliffs, now
      with steep slopes, heavily wooded. After rowing a few hundred yards, it
      seemed as though they were shut out from all the world. Behind and before
      there was a circle of hills, and they seemed to be rather upon the bosom
      of some sequestered lake than upon an inlet of the sea close by the waters
      of the stormy Atlantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      They still moved on, and as they advanced, the scenery retained the same
      general features, possessing an air of wild and romantic grandeur of the
      most striking description. At length they came to a place where the cove
      widened into a smooth basin, surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills. The
      water was as smooth as glass, and as black as ink. This, they were
      informed, was the head of the cove; and straight in front of them was the
      base of Aspotogon, which was bathed by these waters. The boat approached a
      grassy knoll close by this, and the boys all got out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, then, the mystery was solved, for they had come up by this
      passage-way to Aspotogon itself. Close beside them there was a steep
      declivity, bare of trees just here, and covered with stones. Far up trees
      began, and hid the summit of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picturesque beauty of this place, the deep, black water, the high,
      encircling hills, the sombre, primeval forests, the utter seclusion, all
      produced a profound impression upon the minds of the boys, who always were
      alive to the beauties of nature, and who here had something in addition to
      natural beauty. For their thoughts turned at once to that which had been
      for days the supreme subject in their minds&mdash;the treasure of the
      buccaneers. Was not this the haunt of the pirates spoken of by the
      governor of Sable Island. They all felt sure that it must be. No better
      place than this could be found in all the world. Here was a hiding-place
      without a parallel. Here a vessel might pass from the outer seas into
      absolute seclusion, and find a haven safe from all storms, shut in by high
      hills. Here, too, was a place to bury their treasure, if such was their
      desire; and, if the governor of Sable Island had spoken the truth, the
      place best fitted to receive the pirate&rsquo;s deposit must be the very knoll
      on which they were standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here it was, on this spot, that they regretted most deeply the absence of
      the landlord. It was this knoll, above all things, that seemed to them to
      contain the plunder of the Spanish Main, and they felt sure that, if the
      landlord had been here, he would have told them all about it, and
      confirmed their suspicions. But he was not here, and his substitute
      Turnbull was of no use whatever. He either could or would tell them
      nothing. He would only answer in monosyllables, and the boys, after a
      fruitless effort to draw him out on the subject of Deep Cove and its local
      traditions, gave up the task in despair. They could only console
      themselves by the thought that they could pump the landlord on their
      return to Chester, and then, if their suspicions were confirmed, they
      could visit the place again, and dig for the buried treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what a glorious place it was to dig, if this indeed was the place
      which they supposed it to be! How completely shut out it was from all
      observation. Here they might dig to their hearts&rsquo; content, and nobody
      would know it. Perhaps the treasure was not very far down. The knoll rose
      not more than ten feet or so above the sea. Some of them, indeed, thought
      that the whole knoll was the work of the pirates, and was neither more nor
      less than the mound of earth with which they had covered up their
      treasure. This view was even more charming than the other, and they went
      about it on every side, examining it all over, and scrutinizing it most
      carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Tom made a discovery of a very unpleasant character. As he
      wandered about, he found himself, all at once, upon a regular carriage
      road. It was not a first-class road by any means, but it was a road for
      wheeled vehicles, and, from its appearance, was evidently in constant use.
      The sight of this created at once a deep disappointment, in which all the
      others shared as soon as they saw it. They found that the seclusion of the
      place was broken up. To dig for gold here, by the side of a public road,
      would be a difficult matter, and a very different thing from what they had
      at first supposed. So completely had their minds been impressed by the
      apparent seclusion of Deep Cove, that they had forgotten all about the
      houses and settlements which they had seen, only a short time before, on
      the outer coast. Yet these settlements were only a little distance away,
      and this was, no doubt, the road that joined them together, which had to
      make the circuit of Deep Cove, in order to effect a connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys now seated themselves apart, out of hearing of Turnbull, in order
      to discuss the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be any doubt,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;that this is the mound made by the
      pirates to cover up their treasure. They didn&rsquo;t dig a hole, but covered up
      the treasure by piling earth over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; said &lsquo;Phil; &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t believe that
      we&rsquo;ll have to go very far down, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if any one has ever tried it,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t the slightest mark on the
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t people have tried it, if it is really the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they don&rsquo;t know the actual place; and we may be the first who
      ever suspected this mound. It isn&rsquo;t impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it may be that the people here are too dull; or it may be just a
      happy guess of ours, which has never occurred to any one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this miserable road here,&rdquo; said Tom, dolefully, &ldquo;is going to spoil
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if we couldn&rsquo;t manage to dig, in spite of the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we might stick up the sail of the Antelope, and make a big tent, and
      pretend to be fishing, or roughing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there may be something in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something! Of course there&rsquo;s everything in that. I call it a good idea,
      and the only way we can go about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t we be bothered with visitors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; certainly not; or, at any rate, they couldn&rsquo;t get in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;d see the earth thrown up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we wouldn&rsquo;t throw up much. I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;d have to dig far, and
      we could put up both sails, so as to cover up everything. Some of us could
      watch, to give notice to the diggers to knock off in case any one passed
      by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not a bad idea; and it&rsquo;s the only thing we can do. So it&rsquo;s
      worth trying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but there&rsquo;s one thing first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ll have to talk with the landlord, and see if we can find out
      from him what the probabilities are about this place being really the
      resort of the old buccaneers.&rdquo;

      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE boys at length had
      exhausted all their powers of examination, speculation, and conversation,
      and began to look about for something to do. It was not yet the
      appropriate time to dig into what they now all called the &ldquo;mound,&rdquo; though
      that would have been the most agreeable thing in the world in their
      present frame of mind; so they had to think of some other form of active
      exercise. Phil suggested that they should climb Aspotogon, and the
      suggestion was at once welcomed. Here they were at its base. They had come
      to visit it, and they could not be said to have done it, unless they
      should also reach its summit. So no sooner was the suggestion made than
      they all prepared to put it in execution. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The place which they chose for the ascent was that open spot already
      mentioned. Other places were overgrown with a thick forest, with
      underbrush, and fallen trees. The ascent was somewhat difficult. The slope
      was steep, and was covered with loose stones that slid at every step. At
      first, one went behind the other, but after a few paces they found that
      this could only be done at the imminent risk of their precious limbs, for
      the stones dislodged by the foremost climber invariably rolled down upon
      the one following. They therefore avoided going behind any other of the
      party, and climbed up abreast. At length the slope of sliding stones was
      traversed, and they reached a place which was covered with the primeval
      forest. Here the ascent was, if possible, even more toilsome. There was a
      thick underbrush through which they had to force their way by a process
      which made their undeniably shabby clothes even more shabby; the ground
      was very irregular, now sinking into holes, again rising into low mounds;
      while at intervals they would encounter some fallen tree, over which they
      had to climb, or else crawl beneath it. Such were the difficulties in the
      way of their ascent.
    </p>
    <p>
      These, however, were all happily surmounted, and the whole party at last
      stood on the summit of Aspotogon. Here a deep disappointment awaited them.
      They had taken for granted that they would be rewarded by an extensive
      view. They hoped to overlook the whole of Mahone Bay, to count its three
      hundred and sixty-five islands, to see the windings of Deep Cove, and
      speculate upon the operations of the buccaneers. But instead of this they
      saw&mdash;nothing. For the summit of the hill was all overgrown with
      trees, which shut out the whole view. Such a reward for so much toil
      excited the deepest disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is Aspotogon!&rdquo; cried Bruce. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a complete sham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk of this place in comparison with Blomidon!&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s
      sacrilege. This place is only a thicket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense to call it a mountain!&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s
      over a couple of hundred feet or so. I know it&rsquo;s ten times harder to go up
      Blomidon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aspotogon&rsquo;s a humbug,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;What do they mean by saying it&rsquo;s the
      highest land in Nova Scotia? It&rsquo;s the most ridiculous nonsense I ever
      heard in my life. Besides, as to Blomidon&mdash;why, the view from that is
      the finest in America. And what is there here? A parcel of scrubby trees!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such being the sentiments of the climbers, it is no wonder that they did
      not linger long on the summit. There was nothing to keep them there; so
      they soon descended. The way down, however, was even worse than the way
      up, especially when they reached the loose stones. For here the stones
      slid from under their feet at every step, and it was almost impossible to
      stand upright. Tom and Phil both went down, and a score of big stones
      rolled about them, and over them, bruising and scratching them; while
      before them a whole cartload of cobble stones and granite boulders went
      bounding down towards the cove. The boys tried it a little way, and then
      took to the trees, where they completed the descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the knoll once more, they all felt tired and hot. Phil
      proposed a bath, and the proposal was most agreeable to all. In a few
      moments their clothes were off and they were all in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The water was pleasantly warm. They had not had a bathe for some time, and
      here it seemed the perfection of bathing. There was no surf; the water was
      as smooth as glass, and gave the quiet of a lake with the salt water of
      the sea. Phil was the best swimmer of them all, and struck out boldly to
      cross the cove. The others followed. On reaching the middle, Phil turned
      off in another direction, to a point on the shore where he saw a curious
      rock that looked like a cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a cave; let&rsquo;s go and see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swam on, and the others followed. They soon reached the place, and
      climbed up over the rough rock, to see what they supposed to be the cave.
      To their disappointment, it was not a cave at all, but only a slight
      recess of no depth in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought we might find some traces of the buccaneers,&rdquo; said Phil, in a
      tone of vexation. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not in luck to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes, we are,&rdquo; said Tom, cheerfully. &ldquo;The discovery of that mound is a
      good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but then there&rsquo;s that public road,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we&rsquo;ll work it yet. Only wait till we get our tent up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the boys plunged in the water, and played, and sported, and
      dived, and floated, and swam this way and that way; now on their backs,
      and again in their natural positions. At length they began to feel tired,
      and directed their course towards the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was last, swimming along leisurely enough, and thinking about the
      mound and its hidden treasure,&mdash;as were all the other boys,&mdash;when
      suddenly he became aware of a movement in the water behind him, as of some
      living thing swimming. It was not any of the boys. They were all ahead;
      and it could not be Turnbull. It was not a man at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant a terrible thought came to him, that sent a pang of dreadful
      anguish through his inmost soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shark!
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the thought that flashed into Tom&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily and fearfully he turned his head, dreading the worst. One glance
      was enough. That glance froze his very life-blood with utter horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, not more than six or eight yards away, he saw a black muzzle on the
      surface of the water, pointing straight towards himself,&mdash;a muzzle
      narrow, and black, and horrible. Tom had never seen a shark; but he had
      read of them, and had seen pictures of them. One look was enough to
      convince him that this was a shark, who had scented them from afar,
      perhaps from the outer sea, and was now about to seize his prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brain whirled, and all the scene for an instant swam before his eyes.
      A half dozen yards! Could he hope to escape? Impossible! Yet, out of utter
      despair, there came to him the strength of a giant. He struck out with
      frantic and frenzied vehemence, shouting and screaming to the other boys,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A shark! a shark! a sha-a-a-a-a-a-a-ark!!!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other boys heard his yells. They looked around and saw all&mdash;the
      ghastly face and staring eyes of Tom, with the horror of his expression,
      and beyond&mdash;the black muzzle. At that sight, there seized them all a
      terror equal to that of Tom. In any other position they would have sprung
      to his help. But what help was possible here?
    </p>
    <p>
      None. They were naked. They were unarmed. They were in the water. Helpless
      thus, and despairing, there was nothing which any one of them could do,
      but to swim blindly on. It was an instinct of self-preservation that
      animated them all. They fled as they would have fled from an earthquake,
      or a roaring torrent&mdash;blindly&mdash;in frantic haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one word more was uttered. Not a sound was heard except the plashing
      noise of their movements through the water, and the heavy pantings of the
      exhausted swimmers. Still, though exhausted, not one of them dared to
      slacken his efforts. Not one of them dared to look around. In Tom&rsquo;s mind
      there was the chilling horror of the monster behind, and a curdling dread
      of that moment when he would be seized. In the minds of the others there
      was an equal horror of expectation, as they listened to hear the yell from
      Tom, which might announce that all was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, in his anguish, thought of something that he had once read of about
      sharks. He had read that the shark is cowardly, and is kept off by
      splashing in the water&mdash;at least for a time; just as a wild beast is
      deterred by a fire, or a horse is scared by a log at the road-side. At
      this thought he grasped. It was his only hope. As he swam, he plashed in
      the water, with all his force, with arms and legs, making it boil and foam
      all around him. This retarded his progress somewhat; but at any rate, it
      seemed to prolong his safety, for the monster did not seem inclined to
      draw nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moments passed on. They were not far from land,&mdash;yet, O, how far
      that distance seemed to each despairing swimmer! Upon their distance what
      issues depended! O, that they had thought of the danger in time, or had
      seen it a little while before!
    </p>
    <p>
      The moments passed on&mdash;moments terrible, full of sickening anguish,
      of horror intolerable! How long those moments seemed! To Tom each moment
      was prolonged to the duration of an age, and an age of hideous expectation&mdash;expectation
      of a doom so frightful, so abhorrent, that every nerve tingled, and every
      fibre of his body quivered. And there, through the noise of the splashings
      made by his own efforts, he could plainly distinguish the movements of the
      monster behind. It did not seem nearer, but it was near enough to seize
      him at any moment. Why did the monster delay? Was it his splashings which
      deterred it? Tom hoped so, and thrust the water aside with greater energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he could hear the movement of the monster a little towards his
      right. It seemed to him that his pursuer was about to close with him, to
      attack him from another quarter. He remembered reading somewhere that
      sharks swim around their prey before seizing it. This movement, he
      thought, was for that purpose. Every moment he expected to see the dread
      form of that pursuer appearing between him and Phil, who was nearest. But
      he dared not look to assure himself. There was too much horror in the
      awful sight. He dared not turn his head to look behind; he dared not turn
      his eyes even to one side. He could only keep them fixed, with a wide
      stare, upon vacancy, straight before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moments passed on,&mdash;the awful moments, each of which threatens
      death, when the delay of the impending doom fills the soul with awful
      suspense; still the monster hesitated to seize his prey. Still Tom&rsquo;s ears
      rang with the noise of his pursuer. Still the other boys, as though their
      tongues were frozen into silence, hurried to the shore. Still they waited,
      expecting every instant to hear the terrible shriek which should announce
      the awful doom of Tom. But the doom was still delayed, and still Tom
      waited, and still the others listened. So they all hastened, till each
      one&rsquo;s heart seemed almost ready to burst, through the frenzied energy of
      his efforts, and the intensity of his emotions. And there, behind them
      all,&mdash;a little on Tom&rsquo;s right,&mdash;the black muzzle advanced over
      the surface of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that desperate struggle, when they made such frantic efforts to reach
      the shore, Bruce happened to be first. The shore to which they were
      swimming was that which happened to be nearest; not the grassy knoll
      before mentioned, but a beach covered with gravel, which was intermixed
      with larger stones. Bushes grew close down to this beach, and beyond these
      was that road which had so disgusted the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this place Bruce first arrived. His feet touched bottom. No sooner did
      he feel the solid ground under his feet, than all his panic left him, all
      his courage returned, and his presence of mind. Tom&rsquo;s expected death-yell
      had not yet burst upon his ear; not yet had his shriek announced the grasp
      of the monster. There might yet be time to save. In an instant he had
      thought of what he should do. Plunging through the water, and bounding
      forward, he soon reached the beach; and then, stooping down, he hastily
      gathered several large stones. Then he turned, and rushing back a few
      steps, stood with uplifted arm, taking aim, and preparing to hurl these
      stones at the monster. At that very moment Arthur reached the place, and
      turned to look back, standing close by Bruce. Phil was now only a few
      yards away, swimming in, with horror yet stamped upon his face. Beyond him
      was Tom, swimming, kicking, plunging, rolling, dashing the water in all
      directions, and making as much commotion as would have satisfied an
      ordinary whale. As Tom thus swam on, his despairing glance caught sight of
      the forms of Bruce and Arthur. There they stood, up to their waists in
      water&mdash;Bruce with uplifted arm, holding an enormous stone, which he
      was about to throw&mdash;while in his other hand were several more stones.
      Arthur stood by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom devoured them with his eyes; and he struggled on, wondering, yet
      scarcely daring to hope&mdash;wondering whether the stone which Bruce was
      preparing to throw would drive back the monster. To him it seemed that
      Bruce was delaying for an unaccountable time. Why did he stand idle, when
      every moment was so precious? Why did he delay to throw? Why did he not do
      something? Why did he stand there as if rooted to the spot, doing nothing?
      Was there some new horror? Were the monster&rsquo;s jaws already opened to seize
      his prey?
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom would have cried to Bruce to throw, but he could not speak. Not a
      sound could he utter. The thought came to him that Bruce was afraid to
      throw, for fear that the stone might strike him instead of the shark. What
      matter? Far better to throw, and run the risk. This he would have said,
      but he could not in that paralysis of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a frown came over Bruce&rsquo;s face&mdash;which frown as suddenly
      faded away, and was succeeded by a blank look, accompanied by an
      indescribable expression. The same changes passed over Arthur&rsquo;s face. Tom
      saw it all, in his despair, and was bewildered. What was this? Were they
      deserting him? Would they give him up? Impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it seemed as if they would. For suddenly Bruce&rsquo;s uplifted arm
      descended, and the stones all dropped into the water. The blank look upon
      his face was succeeded by one of astonishment, which faded away into
      various expressions, which successively indicated all the varying shades
      of vexation, shame, and sheepishness. Arthur&rsquo;s face was equally eloquent.
      Had not Tom&rsquo;s feelings so pre-occupied him, he might have found a study in
      those two faces; but as it was, he was not in a position to think of such
      a thing; for these looks and gestures only served to inspire him with
      greater alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can do nothing,&rdquo; he thought; and the thought brought to his soul a
      bitterness as of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Phil&rsquo;s feet touched bottom. He rushed up to Bruce and
      Arthur, and turned, as they had turned, to look back.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the same moment the abhorrent sight appeared to Tom&mdash;of the
      black muzzle shooting through the water close by his right shoulder.
      Involuntarily he shrunk aside, with the thought that his last hour had
      come.

       style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>UDDENLY a roar of laughter burst from
      Bruce. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dog! It&rsquo;s a dog!&rdquo; he cried.&mdash;&ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s shark&rsquo;s turned out to be
      a dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And saying this, he burst into another roar of laughter. The laughter
      proved contagious. Arthur and Phil both joined in. Their recent horror had
      been so great, that this sudden and unexpected turn affected them in a
      comical way, and the reaction was in proportion to their former panic
      fear. So their laughter was loud, boisterous, and unrestrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very moment when this cry had burst forth from Bruce, together with
      the peals of laughter, Tom had shrunk back in horror from the black muzzle
      that appeared on his right. But as he did so, and at the very moment of
      this horror in which his eyes were fixed on the monster, this monster
      became plainly revealed, and he saw it as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw, what Bruce and the others now saw&mdash;a dog! a dog whose long,
      sharp muzzle and forehead were above the water, as also part of his back
      and his tail. He was a hound of some kind. Where he had come from, or
      where he was going to, or why he had appeared among them, they were, of
      course, unable to conjecture. Their whole recent terror had thus been the
      result of pure fancy in Tom&rsquo;s case, and in the case of the others the
      result of Tom&rsquo;s first shriek of alarm. In the case of all of them,
      however, the whole trouble was owing to the belief, of which they were not
      yet able to divest themselves, that this cove was some very sequestered
      spot. So convinced had they been of this, that even the sight of a public
      road had not altogether disabused them. They had been determined to find
      here the haunt of the buccaneers, and were unwilling to think that it
      might be a common resort, or even a regular thoroughfare. And therefore,
      when Torn had first caught sight of this black muzzle appearing above the
      surface of the water, he had been incapable of thinking about anything
      except a shark; and the horror that this thought created within him had
      been communicated to the others by his cries. Tom was the real cause of
      the whole mistake, and no one felt this more keenly than Tom himself; yet
      the others were all too much ashamed of their own recent terrors to twit
      or taunt him with his unfounded alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog now swam alongside of Tom, and a little ahead of him, turning once
      or twice, and showing his face&mdash;not the cruel face of a monster of
      the deep, but the mild, humane, civilized, and benevolent countenance of a
      hound of the highest respectability; a face the sight of which made Tom
      feel renewed shame at his foolish and baseless fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other boys walked up to the beach, and Tom soon joined them. The hound
      joined them also. He was a very friendly dog, and shook himself so
      violently that they all received a shower-bath from him. They patted him,
      and petted him, and stroked him; and these friendly advances of theirs
      were received in the politest possible manner by the well-bred hound, who
      finally planted himself on his haunches in the attitude known to dogs as
      &ldquo;begging,&rdquo; which so affected the boys, that they would have given him some
      biscuit if their coats had not unfortunately been elsewhere. But the dog
      had evidently his own business to attend to, for after a short delay he
      took his leave, and trotted up the road. This sudden and unexpected turn
      which had been given to what had, at one time, seemed like the most
      terrible of tragedies, rapidly restored their strength and spirits, in
      spite of the tremendous sensations which they had but recently
      experienced, and the exertions which they had put forth. They now prepared
      to return to the place where they had left their clothes; and since the
      fear of sharks had departed, they took to the water again, and soon
      reached the knoll. Here they clothed themselves, and prepared to return to
      the schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the Antelope, they were all sensible of the most extreme
      fatigue and prostration. The exertions which they had made in the ascent
      and descent of Aspotogon, and more especially in their efforts to escape
      the imaginary shark, were the cause of this in part; but a greater cause
      existed in the intense excitement and terror to which they had been
      subject. They were fortunate, however, in having such a place of refuge as
      the hold of the Antelope, for there they found awaiting them a dinner,
      prepared by Solomon, in which that famous cook had surpassed himself, and
      had turned out the rarest specimens of the culinary art. Their exertions
      had sharpened their appetites, and the long time that had elapsed since
      breakfast made this dinner seem like a banquet. It acted upon them all
      like a charm. Their physical natures were refreshed, and their moral
      natures also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strength came to their bodies, and at the same time to their minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair of the shark was not mentioned. Under other circumstances,
      Bruce, and Arthur, and Phil might have taunted Tom with his absurd
      mistake; but as it was, they were all too much ashamed of their own fears,
      and of their own part in the affair. The consequence was, that all, with
      one consent, allowed the matter to drop, and made no reference to it
      whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner they went upon deck, and found all sail set, and the Antelope
      on her way back to Chester. But there was no wind whatever; it was a dead
      calm, and consequently the return to Chester was not likely to be
      accomplished very speedily. There was, from time to time, a faint puff of
      wind, it is true, which served, perhaps, to prevent the calm from being so
      dead as it might have been; yet, after all, their motion was so slight,
      and their progress so slow, that after two hours they had not put much
      more than a mile between themselves and the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about four o&rsquo;clock when they returned from Deep Cove to the
      Antelope. By six o&rsquo;clock they had not made more than this one mile. The
      boys were now anxious to get back to Chester for various reasons. First,
      they wanted to have a good night&rsquo;s rest at the inn. Secondly, they wanted
      to see the landlord, and ask him all about Deep Cove. Thirdly, they wanted
      to see Bart and Pat, and tell them about their wonderful discovery of the
      &ldquo;Mound,&rdquo; and their theory about the buried treasure. But the failure of
      the wind made it seem impossible for them to get back to Chester that
      night, and there was some talk of anchoring. To this, however, the boys
      would not listen, and they urged Captain Corbet to keep on and take
      advantage of any slight puffs of wind that might arise from time to time.
      Against this request Captain Corbet had no objections to offer, and so it
      was that the Antelope still moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Antelope therefore still held her sails expanded to catch any breath
      of wind that might arise, while the boys lounged along the taffrail,
      looking impatiently around. At another time they would not have failed to
      admire the beauty of the scene&mdash;the blue sea washing the long line of
      shore, and surrounding the numerous isles; but on the present occasion,
      they were too impatient and too tired to be affected by it. Time thus
      passed, and at length the sun went down in the western sky in a blaze of
      glory. By that time the boys found themselves approaching an island, which
      was about three miles from Aspotogon, and which thus indicated to them the
      distance which they had gone since leaving Deep Cove. Less than three
      miles in four hours had been their rate of progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun thus set, and the moon had now come out, throwing a gentler glow
      upon the scene, and lighting it up with wonderful beauty. The edges of the
      hills, and the outlines of the islands seemed all tipped with silver. On
      one side appeared Aspotogon, and Ironbound, and Tancook, rising out of the
      dark, shadowy water; while on the other side the islands shone in the
      lustre of the moon, and there, too, a broad pathway of radiant light lay
      outspread upon the surface of the water, reaching from the schooner to the
      horizon, where a low coast bounded the scene. Never had Ma-hone Bay
      appeared clothed in greater loveliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet had learned a very useful lesson during this last voyage of
      the Antelope, and that was to have some means on board by which he would
      not drift so helplessly. The long drifts which had borne him hither and
      thither over the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and over the ocean, had left a deep
      impression; and accordingly he had taken advantage of this visit to
      Chester to procure a pair of long sweeps, which may be described as oars
      of the largest size. On the present occasion, the sweeps were brought into
      requisition, one of them being worked by Turnbull, Bruce, and Phil, while
      the other was taken in hand by Wade, Arthur, and Tom. The venerable Corbet
      stood at the helm and steered, while Solomon stood at the bows, gazing
      pensively into space, and, as Tom declared, attitudinizing for a
      figure-head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweeps were moved with very long, slow strokes. The two parties who
      managed them at first made an effort to work them in time, but at length
      gave this up, and each made their stroke at random, without reference to
      the others. Whether the Antelope made any progress or not, was not for a
      long time perceptible; but still the boys all felt as though they were
      doing something, and the lapse of time certainly seemed to bring them
      nearer to the island which they had been so long approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exercise was a pleasant one, and in order to cheer their spirits, they
      burst forth into songs. One was volunteered by Tom. <br /><br /><span
      class="indent20">What vessel are you gliding in? <br /><span
      class="indent25">Pray tell to me its name; <br /><span class="indent20">Our
      vessel is the Antelope, <br /><span class="indent25">And Corbet is my name,
      <br /><span class="indent25">And Corbet is my name, <br /><span
      class="indent25">And Corbet is my name; <br /><span class="indent20">Our
      vessel is the Antelope, <br /><span class="indent25">And Corbet is my name.
      </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At this Captain Corbet&rsquo;s venerable face was all suffused with sudden
      smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why railly.&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;railly now, dew tell. Why, ef you ain&rsquo;t ben an
      done it agin. Only think, more rimes about me. Why, it doos beat all. How
      upon airth dew you ever manage to fix em up that way? It doos&mdash;beat&mdash;my&mdash;grandmother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Other songs followed, till almost everything was made use of that they had
      ever heard&mdash;the Canadian Boat Song, the Maltese Boat Song, and others
      of a kindred character, including &ldquo;Hail to the Chief,&rdquo; and &ldquo;March! March!
      Ettrick, and Teviotdale.&rdquo; In this way the time was beguiled, and their
      toil at the long sweeps lightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around them the whole scene glowed in the moonlight. The silver islands
      set in silver seas, clothed in soft lustre, lay reflected in the smooth
      water. Overhead the moon hung in a cloudless sky, and lightened up all
      things with its soft and mellow radiance. They could see also by the
      change in their position, which they noticed from time to time, that they
      were actually making some progress with their sweeps, and the discovery,
      when it was made, encouraged them not a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      So at it they all went again, more vigorously than ever, and sang new
      songs, some of which were of a kind never before heard in these waters.
      One in particular, which was sung to a remarkable fugue tune, was called
      Ode to Disappointment. <br /><br /><span class="indent20">I never had a
      piece of bread <br /><span class="indent20">Particularly wide, <br /><span
      class="indent20">Partic-kik-kik-kik-kik-cu-lar-ly wide, <br /><span

    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This spirited ode was the arrangement of Phil, who prided himself hugely
      upon it. He did not claim it as original, but as having been &ldquo;arranged&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; to its present tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said Bruce at length, &ldquo;I dare say we are making some
      progress; but it strikes me that it hardly pays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;At this rate it&rsquo;ll take us till to-morrow morning to make
      another mile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t object to rowing all night,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;but I do object to row
      without getting the benefit of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;that we vote the sweeps a humbug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I second that motion,&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s being moved and seconded, that the sweeps
      are a humbug. Those of that mind will please manifest it by saying Ay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; rang forth from Arthur, Tom, and Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contrary minds, Nay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a vote,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;And now, gentlemen, we may as well consider
      what&rsquo;s to be done next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well,&rdquo; said Phil, as he and the other boys left the sweeps which
      Turnbull and Wade, however, still kept working. &ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s nothing
      left to do but to turn in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make the best of it,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, boys,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t we take the boat and row to
      Chester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good idea,&rdquo; cried Arthur. &ldquo;Capital. I only wish we&rsquo;d done it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to take the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better wait a little,&rdquo; said the anxious Corbet, who was
      evidently not pleased with the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O there&rsquo;s no use; we want to get to Chester to-night. You&rsquo;ll get along
      before morning. How many miles is it from here?&rdquo; he asked, turning to
      Turnbull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four,&rdquo; said that taciturn individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four miles. Well, boys, what do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m agreed,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything&rsquo;s better than this,&rdquo; said Phil; &ldquo;so I agree to the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this agreement they all turned to the boat, and got in. A few brief
      directions were given by Turnbull, and the boys pulled away. First Bruce
      and Arthur pulled, then Tom and Phil. Taking turns in this way, they had
      the satisfaction of seeing themselves making good progress, and at length
      reached the wharf at Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. They knocked up the people at
      the inn, and hurried up to their rooms. They were so utterly worn out, and
      so sleepy, that they did not think of asking about Bart and Pat, but
      tumbled into bed, and in a few moments were all sound asleep.

      <br /><br /><span class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap"
       style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE, side by side, stood the two boys,
      at the bottom of the deep pit, into which they had descended; and,
      standing there, they looked with unutterable feelings at the opening far
      above them, across which was suspended the treacherous beam. At first
      there was a thrill of expectation, in both of them, that the beam was even
      then breaking, and at any instant might fall and crush them. It had sagged
      down so far, and the fracture was so complete, that the end might come in
      another moment. Thus they stood, and looked up in silence, and with hearts
      that throbbed fast and painfully. Neither of them spoke a word. It was as
      much as they could do to breathe. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      A terrible position it was, and how terrible they knew only too well. One
      hundred feet below the ground, and seventy feet below the level of the sea&mdash;such
      was the depth of that pit. It was so long and so narrow that the bottom
      was quite dark. As they stood with their eyes thus fixed on the
      threatening beam, they noticed that the sky beyond it had changed in its
      color from blue to black, and two or three stars were faintly visible. It
      was like the sky of night, and not like that of day. That little piece of
      sky thus indicated to them the change in their fate, and seemed to frown
      upon them from above.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their minds there was one prevailing sense of mute horror and awful
      expectation; yet, together with this, a thousand other thoughts flashed
      through them&mdash;thoughts of friends, thoughts of home, wild
      speculations as to the possibility of escape; and with these they noticed
      also that black piece of sky, with its faintly-twinkling stars. But
      between them and it, between the upper world which that sky spoke of and
      themselves, there intervened that broken beam stretching across like a
      bar, to shut them in forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, gradually, the first horror passed. It was too intense a feeling to
      endure. The delay of their fate made them calmer, and brought back
      presence of mind; for the beam moved no more&mdash;it fell not&mdash;perhaps
      it might remain as it was, threatening them, but doing no more than that.
      This respite from their doom thus brought them back to themselves, and
      made them search eagerly the sides of the pit as they looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if we can&rsquo;t climb it, thin,&rdquo; said Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; said Bart, in a dejected tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an there&rsquo;s no harrum in given it a thrial,&rdquo; said Pat; and, as he
      said so, he laid his hands upon the staying around the hole. Scarce had he
      done this, than he was aware of a difference between the staying here, and
      that which was higher up. Bart, also, who had done as Pat had done, and
      tried to find some way of climbing, noticed the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the staying below been like that above, the question of their escape
      would very soon have been settled by such practised climbers as these two;
      but, unfortunately, there was a very important difference. Above, the
      staying had been made of stout planks and deals, and these were far enough
      apart to have served for grasping by both hands and feet. They would thus
      have afforded an actual ladder. Below, however, it was very different. The
      staying of the sides of the pit was made, not of planks, which could be
      grasped by the hands, but of round logs, which the hands could not hold,
      though the feet could insert themselves well enough in the interstices.
      These logs rested closely one upon the other, nor was there any way by
      which the hands could pass between them or around them so as to grasp
      them. This, then, was the discovery that Bart and Pat made the moment that
      they tried their hands at climbing; and thus the first plan of escape
      which had suggested itself was baffled most completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we only had the planks!&rdquo; sighed Bart: &ldquo;but these round logs give no
      chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pat made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart then tried to climb at the corner, for here there would be more
      advantage to the feet, since the sides, being at right angles, would
      afford an easier foothold. But, though it was easier for the feet, it gave
      no greater help to the hands than before. Still, there were the round
      logs; nor was there at the angle formed by the sides any spaces sufficient
      to receive the hand and afford a hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we cud only get up as far as the rope,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;it might give us a
      help, so it might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! when that beam is hanging there? Why, if you touched that rope the
      beam would come down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an I forgot that for the moment, so I did,&rdquo; said Pat, dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange we didn&rsquo;t notice that the beam was rotten,&rdquo; said Bart,
      mournfully. &ldquo;It looked sound enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looked as sound as a nut, so it did; and how it managed to howld on
      till I jarked it bates me intirely, so it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been sagging down and cracking all the time. The only wonder
      is, that it didn&rsquo;t give way when we were higher up. If it had, there&rsquo;d
      have been an end of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure &lsquo;n you niver spoke a truer word in your life, so you didn&rsquo;t; an, be
      the same token, it&rsquo;s a good sign, so it is, an a fine thing intirely, that
      we&rsquo;re down here now at this blissid minute, wid our bones not broke to
      smithereens. Sure but it makes me fairly shiver whin I think of you an me,
      one after the other, hangin away up there from that bit of rotten stick
      that was broken all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this wasn&rsquo;t quite so wide,&rdquo; Said Bart, &ldquo;we might stretch our legs
      across, and get up that way. I&rsquo;ve seen men go down into wells as easy as
      you please, just by stretching their legs across.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an meself it is that&rsquo;s seen that same,&rdquo; said Pat, briskly; &ldquo;an I
      wondher whether, afther all, our legs mightn&rsquo;t be long enough to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too wide altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an we might then; an there&rsquo;s nothin like tryin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words Pat set himself to try, and Bart did the same. They tried
      by stretching their legs as far as possible on each side to secure a
      foothold, and thus ascend. Had the pit been narrower, or had their legs
      been longer, they could have done it; but, as it was, they found it quite
      impossible. They could, indeed, touch the beams on either side if they
      stretched their legs as far apart as possible; but, having accomplished
      this, they could do no more. They could not raise their feet higher to the
      log above. So rigid were their legs when thus spread apart, that they
      could not raise them. At length they were compelled to desist from these
      efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too wide intirely, so it is,&rdquo; said Pat, dolefully. &ldquo;An whativer was
      the use of makin the hole so wide is beyond me. It wasn&rsquo;t any use at all
      at all, so it wasn&rsquo;t; an there you have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fault&rsquo;s in our legs as much as in the pit,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;If we were
      five years older we might do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I always thought I cud climb betther thin any man till this blissid
      momint,&rdquo; said Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish I was a man for about five minutes,&rdquo; said Bart, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two minutes&rsquo;d jist do it, so it wad,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An these logs don&rsquo;t go all the way up. If we cud only get up to the
      planks we&rsquo;d be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice particularly,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;but it seems to me that the
      plank staying reaches nearly half way down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full that, ivery inch of it, so it does,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;If we could only get
      up as far as that!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I have it,&rdquo; said Pat, suddenly. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Bart, with some
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; repeated Pat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rope we want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rope!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, a bit of a rope; ony we haven&rsquo;t got one long enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what good would a rope be to us here?&rdquo; asked Bart, in a puzzle to
      know what in the world Pat had got into his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, I have it. Can&rsquo;t we twist a rope an make this longer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re after,&rdquo; said Bart, impatiently. &ldquo;What do you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an we can tear up our coats an shirts, an make a rope that way;
      ony,&rdquo; he added, thoughtfully, &ldquo;it mightn&rsquo;t be long enough, so it
      mightn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re crazy. What do we want of a rope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, to climb with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? Where would you fasten it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fasten it, is it?&rdquo; said Pat, in a dubious tone; &ldquo;sure that same I niver
      thought of at all at all. I forgot all about it, so I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to do something,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stand still here
      and die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the bit of a pick here,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;Sure an we ought to be able
      to do somethin with the pick, so we ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with these words he stooped and lifted up the pickaxe which he had
      thrown in before they went down, and which, in the anguish and excitement
      which they had thus far felt, had been altogether forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to do something with that,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any good to more thin one of us,&rdquo;. said Pat, sadly, &ldquo;for only
      one of us can use it at a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;if one of us can only climb up, can&rsquo;t he help the
      other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an so he can,&rdquo; said Pat; &ldquo;an I niver thought of that, so I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if we can climb with that?&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an we can try,&rdquo; said Pat; &ldquo;an we ought to do somethin, so we ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, he thrust the pick between two timbers, a few feet above
      his head, and then clutching it, he raised himself up to a level with the
      pick, in the easiest way possible. Hanging there for a moment, with his
      hands grasping the pick, and his feet stuck tight between the logs, he
      tried to raise himself higher. To do this, it was necessary to hold
      himself there, while removing the pick, and raising it to the logs farther
      up. But here was the fatal and insuperable difficulty; and this brought
      them exactly back to where they were before. Do what he would, his hands
      could not grasp the round logs with sufficient firmness to maintain a
      hold. After a few efforts he gave it up, and jumped down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart then tried, making his attempt at the corner of the pit, where the
      angle of the two sides favored him more. Striking the pick in between two
      logs, as high up as he could reach, he raised himself up as Pat had done,
      and then tried to lift himself higher. He found a place which he could
      grasp, and clinging to this with a convulsive effort, he raised the pick
      to the logs farther up, and succeeded in thrusting it into a new place.
      Then he drew himself up higher, and once more searched about for a place
      to grasp. But now no place could be found. In vain he tried to thrust his
      fingers between the logs; in vain he sought to grasp the round surface. It
      was a thing that could not be done. After a long but fruitless effort,
      Bart was compelled to give up. Yet he was not satisfied. He tried the
      other three corners of the pit in succession. In all of them his efforts
      met with the same result&mdash;failure, utter and hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he flung down the pick, and stood panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deed, thin, an I&rsquo;m glad to see you back, so I am,&rdquo; said Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad!&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, glad I am; that same&rsquo;s what I mane. I&rsquo;d rather have you fail down
      here, than half way up. You niver cud go all the way; an if you had to
      turrun back when half way up, it&rsquo;s a sore head I&rsquo;d have watchin you; an
      you cud niver expict to git back here again without broken bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we only had one other pickaxe,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;I could do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of coorse you cud; an if we had dizens of other things, you cud do it, so
      you cud, an so cud I; but there&rsquo;s the throuble, an that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got
      to contind against, so it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to do something,&rdquo; said Bart, gloomily and desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an that&rsquo;s thrue for you, so it is, an you niver spoke a thruer word
      in yer life, so you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Pat; &ldquo;an be the same token, it&rsquo;s with
      this pick, so it is, that we&rsquo;ve got to work,&mdash;for it&rsquo;s the only thing
      we&rsquo;ve got at all at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we do,&rdquo; said Bart, in the same gloomy tone, &ldquo;if we can&rsquo;t climb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an there&rsquo;s lots more, so there is,&rdquo; said Pat, who on this occasion
      showed a wonderful fertility of invention. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ben a thinkin,&rdquo; he added,
      &ldquo;that we might dig away these logs with the pick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good would that do?&rdquo; asked Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an we might dig thim out one by one, an pile thim up as we dug thim,
      an so we might make a pile of logs high enough to reach to the top.&rdquo; Bart
      was silent for a few moments. The suggestion was certainly of some value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether we mightn&rsquo;t shake that log down on us, by pounding away
      down here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it&rsquo;s the only thing,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to run some risk, of
      coorse; an I don&rsquo;t think that our blows would be felt so high up. Besides,
      we needn&rsquo;t sthrike very hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the only thing we can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, Pat inserted the point of the pick between the logs near him,
      and tried to pry the lower one out at one end. But the stubborn log
      resisted his efforts. It had been too firmly fixed in its place to yield
      to such a slight force as that which he could bring. Bart lent his
      efforts, and the two exerted themselves with their utmost strength, but
      altogether in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we cud ony git out one log,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;it wud be aisy workin out the
      others, so it wud; but this one seems a tough customer, so it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ought to be some log about here,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;weaker than others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an that&rsquo;s thrue for you,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;an so we&rsquo;ll jist thry thim all
      one afther another, ivery one of them. We&rsquo;ve got lots of time, so we
      have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, here&rsquo;s a smaller one,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pat struck the point of the pick where Bart pointed, and once more the two
      boys exerted themselves to pry out the log. But though this one was
      somewhat smaller than the other, it was quite as firmly fixed, and the
      utmost efforts of both of them failed to move it, even in the slightest
      degree, from its bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an there&rsquo;s no danger of this pit iver cavin in,&rdquo; said Pat, as he
      desisted from his efforts. &ldquo;They made this pit strong enough to howld a
      iliphant, so they did&mdash;the worse for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to try every log that&rsquo;s within reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an we ought to find some weak spot if we do, so we ought,&rdquo; said Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart now inserted the pick between the logs just above the last one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is jist what we intinded to do whin we come down,&rdquo; said Pat; &ldquo;for
      weren&rsquo;t we goin to thry to git to the money-hole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bart said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two boys now tugged away as before. But the result was the same, for
      this log was as firmly fixed, as tough, and as obdurate as the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it&rsquo;s hard, so it is, that the very log we trusted our lives to
      should turrun out to be rotten, an all these logs here should be as sound
      an as strong as steel an iron, ivery mother&rsquo;s son of thim. If we cud only
      find a rotten one, an pull it out of its place, we&rsquo;d be able to git at the
      others aisy, and haul out all the rist of thim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys now tried other logs, one after the other; but from all of them
      they met with the very same stubborn resistance. They had all been placed
      here evidently by men who worked comscientiously, and were determined to
      leave no weak spot exposed to the pressure of the earth. And, as was
      natural, that which had withstood so well the pressure of the surrounding
      soil, was easily able to withstand the puny efforts of a couple of boys.

      this way they went over all the logs, and at length reached the lowest
      layer of all. At this point, Pat&rsquo;s superior dexterity with the pick
      enabled him to invent and to put in practice a plan which could not have
      been used before, or with any of the logs except these lowest ones. For
      beneath these was the earth, and Pat&rsquo;s plan was the natural and simple one
      of digging this earth away, and so undermining the log that lay there. Pat
      worked nimbly and thoroughly, and as he loosened the soil, Bart scraped it
      away with his hands. Pat dug down to the depth of a foot all along, and
      then thrust the pick far in, scooping out the earth that lay on the other
      side of the log. In this way they succeeded in removing the earth that
      kept the log in its place, and at length they were able to detach it, and
      draw it forth. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The removal of this one log served to make the removal of the others
      possible. By diligent efforts the four logs which composed the lower tier
      were detached. The side logs were too long for the pit, and therefore had
      to be placed erect, and leaned against the side. The end logs could lie
      down easily. The second tier then followed, and was removed more easily
      than the first. Then the third tier was detached, and the fourth. In each
      case the logs of the side had to be stood erect, while the end logs were
      laid on the ground at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      A serious difficulty now appeared before the boys, and one, too, for which
      they had not been prepared. The length of the side logs was a very
      embarrassing circumstance. They were too long to be placed at the bottom,
      and had to be stood up. But this took up space, and infringed very
      seriously upon the narrow area in which their operations were carried on.
      In passing from one side to remove the logs on the other, they had to lift
      these backward and forward so as to get them out of the way&mdash;a work
      which was most exhaustive, and at the same time hindered them in their
      proper efforts. Still they kept on, until at length about eight tiers of
      logs had been removed, and the longer ones filled up so much space, that
      it was quite impossible to do any more. They still worked away at those
      which were within reach, and managed to remove a dozen logs more; but
      after this they could do nothing, for the bottom of the pit was completely
      filled, and the staying was now a compact mass from which nothing further
      could be detached until the logs were removed which were covered up by
      those piled against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart and Pat were now compelled to desist for a time, and as they felt
      quite exhausted, they raised themselves to the top of the pile of upright
      logs, and there sat down. Scarcely had they done this, when they were
      aware of a trembling all around, like an earthquake. In horror they sprang
      to their feet. The sides seemed to be moving; the logs separated, and
      descended, and through the crevices there protruded sand and clay. It was
      as though the whole mass of the casing was falling in. In an instant they
      knew what it was. In their thoughtlessness they had taken away the
      foundations of this structure, and it was all falling in. An involuntary
      cry of terror burst from both. They shrank together, clinging to the pile
      on which they stood, and awaited their last hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But once again there was a respite. The movement ceased. The worst seemed
      to be over, at least for the present. Yet the result of this one movement
      was fearful as far as it went. All the logs of the casing seemed severed
      and distorted, and had apparently descended as far as they had dug away
      the foundations. Seeing this, another frightful thought came&mdash;the
      broken beam above. They looked up fearfully. As yet, however, the danger
      impending hesitated to strike, for there, across the mouth of the hole,
      they saw the broken beam defined against the sky. It did not appear to
      have moved; nor was there that appearance of irregularity about the upper
      casing of the pit which now marked the lower. It seemed to them as though
      the slighter staying of plank had been put in the upper part of the pit,
      because it was clay, and needed but little protection; but down below,
      where the soil was looser, stout logs had been required. As they looked
      up, they saw that all this lower casing of logs had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had they discovered this than they saw also something which
      inspired them with hope. Not only had the lower staying of logs thus
      descended, but it had also lost its cohesion, and the logs all seemed to
      be separated by spaces of more or less width, while many of them protruded
      into the pit as though thrust in by the pressure of the earth. Now they
      recognized at a glance the tremendous risk that they had run while
      removing the lowest logs; but at the same glance they perceived that the
      immediate danger had passed, and that they were now at least less helpless
      than before. For now, at last, there need be no difficulty about climbing.
      Now the spaces between the logs were wide enough for them to find
      something which they might grasp with their hands, and for some distance
      up, at any rate, they could see what seemed like a ladder, up which they
      might climb in search of escape from this fearful place.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had they made this discovery than they at once caught at this
      prospect which thus had so unexpectedly opened before them, and began to
      climb. The task was not very difficult. Each one took a corner of the pit
      where the meeting of the two walls favored the ascent, and for some time
      they continued to mount without much difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure but I&rsquo;m afraid this is too good to last,&rdquo; said Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart made no reply. That very fear was in his own mind. In that suspense
      he could say nothing. At last they had mounted as high as the place where
      the rope had broken. The end hung here suspended most tantalizingly. O,
      what joy it would have been for them had it been the rope alone which had
      thus broken,&mdash;if the beam had only continued sound; but now that rope
      was useless, and they dared not touch it for fear lest even a touch might
      bring down upon their heads the beam that hung there impending over them.
      Fortunately they were able to ascend yet higher, for still above them the
      log casing had been started asunder, and still they found themselves able
      to grasp places of support. The staying had certainly undergone a
      universal disintegration, and nothing but its great compactness had
      prevented it from falling in ruin over their heads, and burying them
      alive. It was with amazement and consternation that they recognized their
      work, and these feelings would have overwhelmed them had they not found
      the result, after all, so fortunate for themselves. The risk had passed
      away. For the present, at least, they were receiving the benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fear which Pat had expressed, and which Bart had felt without
      expressing, that the ascent was too good a thing to last, was at length
      proved to be only too well founded. After they had climbed some distance
      farther, they found their ascent brought to an abrupt termination. For
      here there was a kind of separation between the lower casing and the
      upper; a log bulged forward about a foot, and above this there was a gap
      in the casing about two feet in height which shoved the earth behind, a
      kind of clay, and in this there was a cavity caused by the falling of the
      casing. Above this the casing had held firm, but unfortunately they had
      not reached the planks. They were the same round logs which rose above
      them, and which would be as difficult to scale from this point as they had
      proved from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this ledge, formed by the bulging logs, they clambered, and seated
      themselves, dejected at the termination of their ascent, yet relieved
      slightly by the chance which was now afforded of some rest and breathing
      space. Here they sat, and looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it&rsquo;s hard, so it is,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;to find an ind to it just here,
      whin, if we&rsquo;d only been able to climb twinty or thirty feet further, we&rsquo;d
      have got to the planks, an been all safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bart, looking up, &ldquo;there are the planks; and they&rsquo;re not more
      than thirty feet above us at the farthest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An yit they&rsquo;re as much out of our raich as though they were a hundred, so
      they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have the thirty feet, at any rate,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;Come now;
      can&rsquo;t we manage to get farther up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nivir a farther,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to the ind of our journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;See here, Pat. You spoke of a tunnel once. In fact
      we came down here with the pickaxe on purpose to make a tunnel to the
      money-hole. Well, we&rsquo;re after something more precious than money&mdash;life
      itself. Can&rsquo;t we tunnel up to life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tunnel, is it?&rdquo; cried Pat, in great excitement. &ldquo;Of coorse we can. Ye&rsquo;ve
      jist hit it, so you have. It&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do. We will thin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The soil here seems like clay; and if we cut up behind this casing, it&rsquo;ll
      be comparatively safe,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;We need only cut up to the planks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an we&rsquo;ll have to cut up to the top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no! When we get to the planks, we can break through, and climb them
      like a ladder to the top. Once up to the planks, and we&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break through the plankin is it? Sure enough; right are you; that&rsquo;s what
      we&rsquo;ll do, so it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so that makes only thirty feet to cut away. It&rsquo;ll be hard work
      cutting upwards; but you and I ought to manage it, Pat, when our lives are
      at stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manage it? Of coorse; why not? Only we haven&rsquo;t got that bit of a pick
      with us, so we haven&rsquo;t, for we left it down below; an sorra one of me
      knows what&rsquo;s become of it. It may be buried under the roons of the fallin
      logs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Bart looked at Pat with something like consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he at length, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to go down again&mdash;one of us;
      we must have that pickaxe. I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Pat; &ldquo;meself&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s goin to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you shan&rsquo;t. Poh! Don&rsquo;t be absurd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;m bound to go; and so don&rsquo;t you go too. There&rsquo;s not the laste
      nicissity in life for both of us to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well, then,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to toss up for it. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And saying this, he took out a piece of money, and said to Pat,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Head or Tail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tail.&rdquo; said Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart tossed. Pat lost. It was Pat&rsquo;s business therefore to go down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it&rsquo;s aisy climbin,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;an the pick&rsquo;ll be a help whin I
      return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated on the log, Bart looked down, watching Pat&rsquo;s descent. They had
      climbed about half way up the pit, and Pat had about fifty feet to go
      down. Looking down, it was dark, and Pat at length disappeared from view.
      Bart could only hear him as he moved about. At length there was a deep
      stillness. Bart grew alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pat!&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer came. &ldquo;Pat!&rdquo; he called again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pat!&rdquo; he called, as loud as he could, for he was now thoroughly
      frightened. As he called, he put his feet over, and prepared to descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; Pat&rsquo;s voice came up. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come down. I&rsquo;m coming up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words filled Bart with a feeling of immense relief. He now heard Pat
      moving again, and at length saw him ascending. Nearer he came, and nearer.
      But Bart noticed that he did not have the pickaxe. He feared by this that
      it had been buried beneath the fallen logs. If so, their situation was as
      desperate as ever. But he said not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pat at length reached the place where Bart was, and flung himself down,
      panting heavily. Bart watched him in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pickaxe is buried,&rdquo; said he at length, &ldquo;I suppose.7&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse,&rdquo; said Pat, with something like a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse?&rdquo; repeated Bart in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, worse,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;The water&rsquo;s comin in. There&rsquo;s six feet of it, an
      more too. The hole&rsquo;s flooded, an fillin up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this awful intelligence Bart sat petrified with horror, and said not
      one word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the diggin away at the casin,&rdquo; said Pat, dolefully, &ldquo;an the cuttin
      away of the earth, that&rsquo;s done the business, so it is. I can onderstand it
      all easy enough. Sure this pit&rsquo;s close by the money-hole, an the bottom of
      it&rsquo;s close by the drain that they towld us of. An them that made this hole
      didn&rsquo;t dare to go one inch further. An that&rsquo;s the very thing, so it is,
      that we&rsquo;ve done. We&rsquo;ve cut, and dug, and broke through into the drain.
      What&rsquo;s worse, all the casin an all the earth&rsquo;s broke and fallen down. An
      there&rsquo;s no knowin the mischief we&rsquo;ve done. Any how, we&rsquo;ve broke through to
      the &ldquo;drain&rdquo;&mdash;bad luck to it; and the water&rsquo;s jist now a powerin in
      fast enough. Sure it&rsquo;s got to the top of them logs that we stood upon end&mdash;the
      long ones; and they&rsquo;re more&rsquo;n six feet long, an it&rsquo;s risin ivery minit, so
      it is, an it&rsquo;s comin up, an it&rsquo;ll soon be up to this place, so it will. An
      sure it&rsquo;s lost an done for we are intirely, an there you have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this dreadful intelligence, not a word was spoken for a long time.
      Pat had said his say, and had nothing to add to it. Bart had heard it, and
      had nothing to say. He was dumb. They were helpless. They could go no
      farther. Here they were on this log, half way up the pit, but unable to
      ascend any further, and with the prospect before them of swift and
      inevitable destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had worked long and diligently. Not one mouthful had they eaten since
      morning; but in their deep anxiety, they had felt no hunger. They had
      labored as those only can labor who are struggling for life. And this was
      the end. But all this time they had not been conscious of the passage of
      the hours; yet those hours had been flying by none the less. Time had been
      passing during their long labor at the logs below&mdash;how much time they
      had never suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first indication which they had of this lapse of time was the
      discovery which they now made of a gradually increasing gloom. At first
      they attributed this to the gathering of clouds over the sky above; but
      after a time the gloom increased to an extent which made itself apparent
      even to their despairing minds. And what was it? Could it be twilight?
      Could it be evening? Was it possible that the day had passed away? Long
      indeed had the time seemed; yet, even in spite of this, they felt an
      additional shock at this discovery. Yet it was true. It was evening. The
      day was done. They two had passed the day in this pit. This was night that
      was now coming swiftly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      They remained motionless and silent. Nothing could be done; and the
      thoughts of each were too deep for utterance. Words were useless now. In
      the mind of each there was an awful expectation of a doom that was coming
      upon them&mdash;inevitable, swift, terrible! They could only await it in
      dumb despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night was coming, adding by its darkness to the horror of their situation.
      Death in daylight is bad enough, but in the dark how much worse! And the
      fate that threatened them appeared wherever they might turn their eyes&mdash;above,
      in the shape of that broken beam which yet in the twilight appeared
      defined in a shadowy form against the dim sky; around, in this treacherous
      casing, which, being undermined, might at any moment fall, like the lower
      portion, and crush them; beneath, most awfully, and most surely, are those
      dark, stealthy, secret waters which had come in from the &ldquo;drain&rdquo; upon them
      as though to punish their rashness, and make them pay for it with their
      lives. In the midst of all these fears they remembered the superstitious
      words of the man whom they had questioned, &ldquo;Flesh and blood will never lay
      hands on that treasure, unless there&rsquo;s a sacrifice made&mdash;the
      sacrifice of human life!&rdquo; Such was the declaration of the man on the
      shore, and this declaration now made itself remembered. The sacrifice of
      life. What life? Was it theirs? Were they, then, the destined victims?
      Awful thought! Yet how else could it be? Yes, that declaration was a
      prophecy, and that prophecy was being fulfilled in them. But O, how hard
      it was to die thus! so young! in such a way! to die when no friends were
      near! and where their fate would never, never be known to those friends.

       style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE boys at the inn slept soundly, and
      did not wake until after their usual time. On going down to breakfast,
      they looked about for Bart and Pat. At first they thought that their two
      friends had already taken their breakfast, and gone out; but an incidental
      remark of the landlady made known to them the fact that they had not been
      back to the inn at all. This intelligence they received with serious
      faces, and looks of surprise and uneasiness. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what can be the meaning of it,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were very mysterious about going, in the first place,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t see what sense there was in making such a secret about it. They must
      have gone some distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d be back so soon,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;and have
      planned their own affair, whatever it is, to last as long as ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, they must have known,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;d be back to-day.
      Aspotogon is only a few miles. In fact we ought to have been back
      yesterday, in time for tea, by rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where in the world could they have gone to?&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, fishing, of course,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they ought to have been back last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, they&rsquo;ve found some first-rate sport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;there wasn&rsquo;t any actual reason for them to come
      back. None of us are in any hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but they may have got into some scrape,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;Such a thing
      is not inconceivable. It strikes me that several members of this party
      have already got into scrapes now and then; and so I&rsquo;m rather inclined to
      think that the turn has come round to Bart and Pat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m inclined to think,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;is, that they&rsquo;ve gone off in a
      boat for a sail before breakfast, and have come to grief somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if they tried a sail-boat, they were pretty sure of that,&rdquo; said
      Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Phil; &ldquo;neither Bart nor Pat know anything more about sailing a
      boat than a cow does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t have fallen into any very serious
      danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There hasn&rsquo;t been any wind worth speaking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither there has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there was some wind yesterday morning,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;It carried us
      to Aspotogon very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! Such a wind as that wouldn&rsquo;t do anything. A child might have sailed
      a boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t know. That wind might have caught them off some island, and
      capsized them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that wind could have capsized even a paper boat,&rdquo; said
      Phil; &ldquo;but still I&rsquo;m inclined to think, after all, that they&rsquo;ve met with
      some sort of an accident in a boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t meet with any kind of
      accident. My opinion is, that they went off fishing, kept at it all day,
      got too far away to think of coming back last night, and so very naturally
      put up at some farm-house, where they have by this time eaten a good,
      rattling breakfast, and are on their way back, walking like the very
      mischief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most natural thing in the world too,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;I quite agree with
      Tom. It&rsquo;s just what any other two of us fellows would have done. In the
      first place, they backed out of the Aspotogon expedition very quietly, so
      as not to make a fuss, then they went off&rsquo;, and, as Tom says, got too far
      to come back; though whether they&rsquo;ve had such a tremendous adventure as
      ours at Deep Cove with the shark is a matter that has yet to be decided.&rdquo;
       This first allusion to the shark was received by all the party with a
      solemn smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;I believe they&rsquo;ve taken to a boat. Perhaps they&rsquo;ve
      gone cruising about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they couldn&rsquo;t have been capsized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how do you account for their absence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily enough,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;I believe they&rsquo;ve gone visiting some of the
      islands, and somehow they&rsquo;ve lost their sail, or their oars, or else
      they&rsquo;ve been careless about fastening the boat, and she&rsquo;s drifted away.
      And so I dare say that at this very moment they are on some desert island
      in this bay, within a mile or so of this town, looking out for help; but
      if they are, they must be pretty hungry by this time, for it isn&rsquo;t every
      island that can furnish such a bill of fare as Ile Haute gave to Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A perfectly natural explanation,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those two fellows are both so abominably careless, that, if they did go
      ashore on any island, they&rsquo;d be almost certain to leave the boat loose on
      the beach, to float away wherever it liked. I believe, as Phil says, that
      they&rsquo;re on some island not far away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;I believe that they went fishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are we to do about it? Oughtn&rsquo;t we to hunt them up?&rdquo; said
      Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the use,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be along by dinner time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sit here and leave them to
      their fate. I believe they are in a fix, and consequently I intend to go
      off to hunt them up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; said Phil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course, if you go, I&rsquo;ll go too,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; said Tom; &ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s the slightest
      necessity. Bart and Pat&rsquo;ll turn up somewhere about noon, and find us gone.
      They&rsquo;ll then go off in search of us. Well, it&rsquo;ll amount to the same thing
      in the end, and so, perhaps, it&rsquo;s the best way there can be of filling up
      the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if the Antelope&rsquo;s got back,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we go down and talk it over with Captain Corbet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words the boys rose from the breakfast table, and went down to
      the wharf. As they approached they saw the Antelope lying there at her
      former berth; for she had arrived about an hour before, and had come here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, boys,&rdquo; said he, as he saw them, &ldquo;here we air once more, jined
      together as before; though whether you did well in a desertin of the ship
      in mid-ocean is a pint that I don&rsquo;t intend to decide. You might as well
      have turned into your old quarters aboard, an slep calm an comfortable,
      instead of rowin six or eight mile by night. However, you don&rsquo;t none o&rsquo;
      you look any the wuss for it, an so we&rsquo;ll let bygones be bygones. Ony I&rsquo;m
      pleased, likewise relieved, to see you here, instead of havin to larn that
      you&rsquo;re among the missin, an probably roamin the seas in a open boat. An
      where, may I ask, air Bart and Pat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer to this question plunged the good Corbet from the comfort in
      which he had settled himself, down into the depths of anxiety and
      worriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Not back yit?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so. Is this railly so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! all yesterday, an all last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An no word of partin&mdash;and no directions as to where they went, an
      when they&rsquo;d return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An nobody seen them go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An nobody&rsquo;s seen anythin of them at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An you don&rsquo;t even know whether they&rsquo;re in danger or safety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor even whether they&rsquo;re on land or water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet shook his head slowly and sadly, and turned away with the
      profoundest dejection and melancholy depicted upon his venerable yet
      expressive features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom and I think they&rsquo;ve gone off fishing,&rdquo; continued Bruce, who had told
      the tale of woe; &ldquo;but Arthur and Phil are afraid that they&rsquo;ve gone off in
      a boat, and have met with some accident. They&rsquo;re determined to go off to
      hunt them up, and we&rsquo;ve concluded to go too, as we don&rsquo;t care about
      staying behind doing nothing; though, at the same time, we don&rsquo;t believe
      they&rsquo;ve come to any harm, and we think they&rsquo;ll be coming after us. We
      thought we&rsquo;d let you know; and perhaps we&rsquo;d better put off in the
      Antelope, unless you think a small boat would be better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go in a small boat. The Antelope won&rsquo;t do.
      There&rsquo;ll be another calm, and we&rsquo;ll have to stand still and do nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could get one of these whalers,&rdquo; said Phil, pointing to a number of
      boats at the wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
      These boats were sharp at each end, and were therefore called &ldquo;whalers&rdquo; on
      account of their shape, and not because they were ever used, or ever
      intended to be used, against whales. They were large and capacious, and
      well ballasted; while, at the same time, they were not too large to be
      rowed, in case of calms or head winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, bother the whalers,&rdquo; said Tom&rsquo;; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s stick to the Antelope, whatever
      we do. Whenever we leave the Antelope, we&rsquo;re sure to come to grief.
      Besides, I don&rsquo;t like to have to stuff myself into a little open boat. I
      like to move about, and walk up and down, and change my position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I, for that matter,&rdquo; said Phil; &ldquo;but then, you know, we may be
      caught in a calm, as we were last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, there&rsquo;s lots of wind now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it mightn&rsquo;t last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if it don&rsquo;t, we can take to the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, our little row-boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we can&rsquo;t go any distance in her; she&rsquo;s too small.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, let&rsquo;s get a whaler,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;and then we&rsquo;ll be ready for wind or
      calm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;if I thought that Bart and Pat were really out
      anywhere in the bay, I&rsquo;d say, take a whaler; but as I consider this
      expedition a wild-goose chase, I go in for comfort, and vote for the
      Antelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t do anything; that&rsquo;s all; and if they are in danger, we&rsquo;ll
      be sorry for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I&rsquo;ll run the risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a tie,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give Captain Corbet the casting vote.
      Come, captain, what do you say about it? Do you think they&rsquo;re on land or
      water? and do you advise a whaler or the Antelope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, mournfully. &ldquo;Me? Wal, for my part, I&rsquo;ve come to
      believe the wrust. I believe them two air at this moment on some lone rock
      of the deep, gazin in despair upon the waste of water, and lookin wildly
      in all directions for help. And so it ever hath been, and ever shall be.
      Amen. For my part, I&rsquo;m free to say, that I never see, nor never hear tell
      of, nor never even dreamt of the likes of you. If you get out of my sight
      for one moment, you&rsquo;re sure to be engaged in reskin your lives about
      nothin. An I&rsquo;ll give up. If Providence restores them two, I hereby declar
      solemn, that it&rsquo;s my fixed intention to start right straight off for hum;
      never to stop at one single place, nor even to go near any land, till I
      touch the wharf at Grand Pré. What this here&rsquo;s goin to end in beats me;
      and this last business doos beat my grandmother. As for you, I advise you
      to stick to the Antelope, and sail under the old flag. Them&rsquo;s my
      sentiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This advice of Captain Corbet was accepted as his decision, and so it was
      resolved to set off in the Antelope, and cruise round the bay. Such a
      search was, of course, not very promising; but Arthur and Phil had a vague
      idea that in the course of the cruise they would see the two missing ones
      making signals of distress from some lonely island, and that thus they
      might be rescued. As for Captain Corbet, he still remained melancholy,
      though not at all despairing; for though he insisted that the boys were in
      some danger, he yet believed that they would be rescued from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this conversation, they were interrupted by the appearance
      of the landlord. He had just returned from that journey up the country,
      which had prevented him from accompanying them to Aspotogon on the
      previous day. He had learned at the inn the state of affairs, and had at
      once come down to the wharf. The boys, on the other hand, knowing that he
      had been up the country, thought it possible that he might have seen or
      heard something of their missing friends; and therefore, no sooner had he
      made his appearance, than they all hurried to meet him, and poured upon
      him a whole torrent of questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord&rsquo;s answer was a complete defeat of all their hopes. He had
      seen nothing of Bart and Pat, and had heard nothing of them. He had known
      nothing of their departure, and nothing of their absence, until a few
      moments before, on his arrival home. He himself had to question them to
      find out the facts of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the facts of the case, however, they themselves were, unfortunately,
      quite ignorant. They had nothing to communicate but fancies, conjectures,
      and speculations, more or less plausible, such as they had just been
      discussing. To these the landlord listened with the profoundest attention
      and the deepest gravity, and then considered them all in succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; said he, at length, &ldquo;that I see any danger for them in any
      way. Praps they&rsquo;ve gone in a boat, an praps they&rsquo;ve gone fishing. If
      they&rsquo;ve gone in a boat, why, there hasn&rsquo;t been wind enough to capsize a
      walnut-shell. An as to getting on an island, I don&rsquo;t see how their boat
      could drift away, unless they made it go, and actually shoved it off on
      purpose. You must remember that this bay ain&rsquo;t like the Bay of Fundy.
      There ain&rsquo;t any tides or currents here worth mentioning. The tide only
      rises and falls six or seven feet, and the currents are so trifling that
      they ain&rsquo;t worth considering. If these boys have got on an island and been
      left there, it&rsquo;s a puzzle to me how on earth they managed it. Then, again,
      there are boats and schooners passing backward and forward almost all the
      time, and if they had got ashore anywhere, they&rsquo;d have been got off by
      this time. So it&rsquo;s my opinion that they haven&rsquo;t gone off in a boat, but
      that they&rsquo;ve gone fishing. If they&rsquo;ve gone fishing, it&rsquo;s the most likely
      thing in the world for them to go off a good bit, and not be able to get
      back the same day. The only trouble about this is,&mdash;that they
      wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to go away on foot; and if they got a wagon, they&rsquo;d be
      most likely to take it from the hotel; but that&rsquo;s just what they haven&rsquo;t
      done. So there&rsquo;s a fresh puzzle on top of the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I think they&rsquo;d be just as likely to walk as not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, there&rsquo;s another puzzle. Where could they go? They never made
      any inquiries. We had a long talk the night before last, but not a word
      was said about fishing. If they&rsquo;d been intending to go fishing, they&rsquo;d
      have asked; wouldn&rsquo;t they? Of course they would. That stands to reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I dare say they got up early, and a sudden notion took them, and they
      started off without having any particular place in view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not unlikely,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;and if they did, why, all
      I&rsquo;ve got to say is, they&rsquo;d have a precious long walk of it, for there
      isn&rsquo;t any really decent fishing within less than nine or ten miles; and
      so, if they walked that, and then went up stream, why, by the time they&rsquo;d
      finished, they&rsquo;d have walked ten miles more; and so, all together, they&rsquo;d
      make a precious good day&rsquo;s work of it,&mdash;work enough, in fact, to make
      them rather indifferent about hurrying back here&mdash;especially when
      they&rsquo;d have to do it on foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they&rsquo;d find houses to stop at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes, there are houses enough; but it depends on what direction they
      went. In some places, they&rsquo;d have to camp out for the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they understand that well enough,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Bart and Pat can put
      up as neat a camp as any two fellows going.&rdquo;

      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE remarks of the
      landlord served to weaken the belief of Arthur and Phil in their theory of
      the boat, and they began to doubt the expediency of setting off in the
      Antelope. The easy way also in which the landlord met the difficulties of
      the case, and accounted for everything, had a very great effect in
      diminishing, if not in destroying, the anxiety which they had begun to
      feel. They had nothing to offer in reply, and they naturally gave up their
      proposal. They began to think that the absentees might make their
      appearance at any moment, and that under the circumstances it would be
      very unwise to start off on a long, uncertain, and unprofitable cruise in
      the Antelope. And thus it was that the whole party came to the conclusion
      to remain where they were, and wait for Bart and Pat. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      With this intention they all went back to the inn. On arriving there, they
      found a man who had just come to the house, and was waiting to find the
      landlord. He looked like one of those half farmers, half fishers, who live
      about Mahone Bay; and the boys would not have paid any attention to him,
      had they not been startled by his first words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about a couple o&rsquo; lads,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;jest like them there. I&rsquo;m afraid
      there&rsquo;s somethin gone wrong with &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of &ldquo;a couple o&rsquo; lads jest like them there,&rdquo; all the boys
      started, and gathered round the stranger with eager and anxious curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see,&rdquo; continued the man, &ldquo;it was yesterday morn&rsquo;n,&mdash;an them two
      come a knockin at my door about sunrise, or not much arter, and asked the
      way to Oak Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oak Island!&rdquo; repeated the landlord, in a strange voice. The other boys
      noticed his tone, but as they knew nothing whatever of the character of
      Oak Island, they were of course unable to understand the cause of it, or
      the meaning of those words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems they was a huntin up the way there,&rdquo; continued the man. &ldquo;They
      had a boat with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A boat?&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;a sail-boat, or row-boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sail-boat,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;They were strangers&mdash;that was evident:
      and they wanted to find Oak Island. Wal, I showed them the island, for it
      can be seen plain enough from my door. My name&rsquo;s Roach, an I live on the
      shore up there. So we had some talk about the treasure, an they asked me
      if I believed. An I says, &lsquo;Yes, I do.&rsquo; For at first they thought I didn&rsquo;t
      believe. But I did, an I do. And I says to them, says I, &lsquo;Flesh an blood
      won&rsquo;t never lay hands on that thar treasure till there&rsquo;s a sacrifice of
      human life took place.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what I says, in so many words. Wal, some
      more words followed, an then them two went on an steered to the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I don&rsquo;t know how it was, but I kep a thinkin about them two all day
      long. At last I fell a wonderin why they didn&rsquo;t come back. There wasn&rsquo;t no
      sign of any boat a comin back from that island. They was on it, I knowed;
      an why they staid on it I couldn&rsquo;t make out. It began to bother me. An all
      the time I couldn&rsquo;t help thinkin of what I told em, an the words kep a
      ringin in my ears as to how that there&rsquo;s got to be a sacrifice of human
      life before the treasure&rsquo;s riz out of the hole whar the pirates buried it.
      An I couldn&rsquo;t get them words out o&rsquo; my head. An what&rsquo;s more, I got a
      thinkin that them two lads was kine o&rsquo; connected with them words,&mdash;jest
      as if it was a sort o&rsquo; prophecy like, that I&rsquo;d gone an spoke,&mdash;not
      knowin, an not intendin it, you know, but givin a prophecy all the same,&mdash;as
      is gen&rsquo;rally the case, you know; for often it happens that them that
      prophesies hain&rsquo;t got no intention of so doin, an hain&rsquo;t got no reel idee
      of the meanin of what they&rsquo;re sayin. An that was jest the case with me, an
      it was only afterwards that these thoughts come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, all day long I was in this state, an felt dreadful anxious, an more
      an more so as the day went by. It was yesterday. An I see no signs of that
      thar boat a comin back. An when evenin come I begun to feel pooty skeart,
      an I&rsquo;d a gone off then but darsn&rsquo;t, for fear of the ghosts of them old
      pirates that prowl around on the island arter dark. I didn&rsquo;t close my eyes
      all last night, or sleep a wink, for thinkin o&rsquo; them two lads. It seemed
      to me that I&rsquo;d been kine o&rsquo; to blame&mdash;though whar the blame was, no
      one can say, for I was as innocent of blame as a babe unborn. But so it
      was, an I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. Wal, this morn&rsquo;n I was up before dawn, an into
      my boat, an off for the island. I got thar about sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I landed thar, on Oak Island, an the fust thing I see was that thar
      identical boat that the boys had&mdash;the very one. I couldn&rsquo;t mistake
      it; an it lay hauled up on the beach, an tied thar. But thar wasn&rsquo;t any
      sign of any boys anywhars. I called, an shouted, but no answer come. Wal,
      then I walked up some distance, an looked all around everywhars. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
      much of an island in size; so I soon walked all round it; but I didn&rsquo;t see
      nothin of them thar lads. I looked at one or two of them pits that&rsquo;s ben
      dug thar, but didn&rsquo;t see anythin but water. I kep a screamin an a shoutin
      all the time, but thar wasn&rsquo;t any answer at all. Thar was the boat on the
      beach,&mdash;but whar was the boys? I couldn&rsquo;t see em, I couldn&rsquo;t find em;
      and though I called for em, they didn&rsquo;t answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I went back to the beach, an then I stood an tried to think what I&rsquo;d
      best do. Somethin had happened. I knowed that the best thing to do was to
      make haste an try to let the friends of them lads know how things was. I
      knowed that they was strangers in these parts, an that they&rsquo;d come from
      Chester. I thought I&rsquo;d find out about em here at the inn, an that the best
      an quickest way would be to come right straight off to this place, an see
      if I couldn&rsquo;t larn somethin about em, or find some friends o&rsquo; thairs
      that&rsquo;d come with me back again, an find out, for sure an sartin, what it
      was that had happened. An what troubled me most all the time, and troubles
      me now, is them very words that I said to em as to how that it was
      necessary that thar must be a sacrifice of human life. For I&rsquo;m kine o&rsquo;
      feared that it&rsquo;s turned out true, an that them&rsquo;s the very ones that was
      destined to be that sacrifice. They&rsquo;ve got into some trouble, I know&mdash;but
      how it was I don&rsquo;t know, an whether it was in the day time, or at night.
      This is what I want to find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the boys look like?&rdquo; asked the landlord, as the man ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, jest sech lookin lads as these&mdash;not overly well dressed, in
      fact a leetle mite shabby; but one of them was a gentleman&rsquo;s son,&mdash;no
      doubt o&rsquo; that; an the other was a bright-lookin lad enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bart and Pat. There&rsquo;s no doubt of that,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what sort of a boat was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, an ordinary Chester boat, with a sail, as I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the boat on the beach of Oak Island yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course it is. I left it where it was. But air them thar boys a stoppin
      here? Do you know them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the landlord, in a husky voice; and he stood in silence for a
      few moments, with his eyes cast down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the boys this information had produced an effect which was at once
      distressing and puzzling. It was distressing, from the fact that this
      stranger more than hinted at some possible evil befalling their two
      companions; and his gloomy allusions to his prophecy about the &ldquo;sacrifice
      of human life,&rdquo; together with the expression of his own anxiety, produced
      a corresponding effect upon all of them. But it was also puzzling, for
      they could not imagine what there was on this Oak Island to attract Bart
      and Pat; or, if there was any attraction in it, how Bart and Pat had found
      it out. Various expressions made use of, however, such as his allusions to
      &ldquo;pirates&rdquo; and &ldquo;treasure,&rdquo; served to make them suspect that this Oak Island
      might be the very place, in search of which they had come to Chester, the
      place indicated by the story of the governor of Sable Island; that somehow
      Bart and Pat had made this discovery, and had remained behind, while they
      went to Aspotogon for the express purpose of finding out the place for
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this suspicion they were right, and it was confirmed by the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; he exclaimed, suddenly. &ldquo;I have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I know now why they didn&rsquo;t go with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because they wanted to go to Oak Island.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oak Island? But what is there in Oak Island?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough to attract any one. I told them about it the evening of the day
      you came&mdash;all about the pirates, and how Kidd buried his treasure
      there, and how it was found out, and the different attempts made to raise
      it. It&rsquo;s too long a story now. You can hear it some other time. But I told
      it to them, and they&rsquo;ve gone wild with excitement to visit the island
      themselves. That&rsquo;s it. Yes, that&rsquo;s it. But I didn&rsquo;t think-they&rsquo;d clear out
      this way. What made them do it? They made a great secret of it. What was
      the use of that? And now what in the world has become of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They went to that thar island,&rdquo; said Roach, &ldquo;an they&rsquo;ve never left it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you went all over it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure? Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the boat was on the beach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; an it&rsquo;s thar yet. An if them lads belong to this here party, then my
      advice is, you&rsquo;d better hurry off an find out what&rsquo;s become o&rsquo; them. I&rsquo;m
      dreadful anxious still, an want to know the wust. An I&rsquo;m afeard that if we
      find out anything, it&rsquo;ll be the very wust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this disheartening remark there was no reply made. The boys all felt
      the same. Arthur and Phil, who had at first felt anxious about the
      absentees, now felt a worse anxiety; while Bruco and Tom, who had
      explained away their absence, now knew not what to say or to think.
      Although the evident superstition of the man Roach lessened somewhat the
      value of his testimony, still they could not conceal from themselves the
      fact, that there were grave reasons for alarm,&mdash;such as the boat on
      the shore, and the failure of his cries to reach the ears of the boys.
      Where could they be, that in a circuit of the island, this visitor had not
      been able to see them, or to make his cries heard? What could have
      happened to them? What sort of dangers could have presented themselves?
      The dangers which had been suggested by the superstitious fancy of Roach
      had no terrors in their eyes, and no weight in their minds,&mdash;at least
      in broad day. But there might be other dangers, of a material kind, of
      which they knew nothing. What did he mean by those &ldquo;pits&rdquo; full of water?
      What pits? They could not guess at this, for they had not heard the
      landlord&rsquo;s story, and Oak Island was all an unknown ground to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, then, were the questions and the fears which were started by the
      anxiety of the boys; and the more they thought over these things, the more
      that anxiety increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one thing, of course, now remained to be done, and that was, to
      hasten, as fast as possible, to the place where Bart and Pat had gone, and
      search for themselves after their lost companions. The landlord at once
      began his preparations. The Antelope was not to be thought of. By taking
      her, time would be lost; for it was necessary to start from the back bay,
      which was very much nearer to Oak Island. Roach had landed on that side,
      and his boat, a roomy whaler, was at their disposal. They therefore at
      once decided to embark in her, and go by that way in search of the lost
      ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      They set forth at once, the landlord accompanying them. It was not thought
      necessary to send word to Captain Corbet, as he would not be able to do
      anything, and might only embarrass their movements by an untimely
      fussiness, or by an anxious determination to accompany them in Roach&rsquo;s
      boat. A walk of a few minutes brought them to the back bay, where the boat
      was lying. It was soon afloat, and the party embarked. Then the sail was
      hoisted, and as the wind was fair and fresh, they moved rapidly through
      the water, heading for Oak Island. On the way the landlord informed them
      that he had told to Bart and Pat the story of Oak Island, and gave them a
      kind of summary of the same story. From this the boys were able to
      understand why it was that their absent companions had not accompanied
      them, though they were still at a loss to know why it was that they had
      made such a secret of their plan, and what their purpose had been in thus
      setting out by themselves. They could only conclude that Bart and Pat
      wished to have the whole glory of making some discovery by themselves,
      with which they should astonish their companions; and if there was any
      hope left in their minds, it was that they had purposely secreted
      themselves from Roach, so as not to be disturbed in their investigations.
      And this hope, though it was a faint one, served to sustain them to some
      extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time they reached Oak Island, where they landed at the very
      place which had been chosen by Bart and Pat for their landing. Here the
      first thing that they noticed was the boat which their friends had
      brought, and which lay as they had left it. It was with melancholy
      forebodings that they looked upon it, wondering what had been the fate of
      those who had brought it here. But there was no time to waste in useless
      regrets or idle fears. There was a very serious business before them&mdash;the
      search after their lost companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went up from the beach upon the island just as Pat and Bart had gone,
      and noticed the same things. They came to the mound of bluish clay, and
      saw the pit close by filled with water. They examined this narrowly, as
      though they feared to find their friends here. Then they went on further.
      Another mound, marking the presence of another pit. They now began to
      understand the full meaning of these &ldquo;pits&rdquo; to which Roach had alluded. It
      was with a feeling of great relief that they saw no signs here of their
      lost friends. From this they went on farther to a third pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;how any harm could have happened.
      Two sensible boys like these couldn&rsquo;t have fallen into any trouble here.
      They wouldn&rsquo;t feel inclined to jump into a flooded pit and drown
      themselves. As to this pit, it is dry; and I don&rsquo;t think they would go
      down into it. Why should they? They wouldn&rsquo;t jump down, for they were not
      yet quite tired of life, and there&rsquo;s nothing here to show that they
      lowered themselves down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Each solemnly shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t that. It&rsquo;s the sperits&mdash;the
      ghosts of the old pirates, that allers haunts this island. No man dare
      live on it, except when they come in companies. One or two, men or boys,
      air at their mussy. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no or&rsquo;nary uthly dume that&rsquo;s come over
      them thar lads. It&rsquo;s Kidd an his gang that&rsquo;s ben an done for them.&rdquo;

      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE coming of darkness
      gave a new horror to those which already surrounded Bart and Pat far down
      in the pit. This made them perceive how long they had already been down,
      and threw a new difficulty in the way of escape. But that way of escape
      seemed already to be effectually closed when Pat brought back his terrible
      intelligence from the bottom of the pit. They had formed a new plan, which
      had given them hope; but now the only way of carrying out that plan into
      execution was snatched from them by the advance of the waters. There was
      nothing for them to do. To climb up the log casing was impossible, and to
      dig through the clay was equally so without some strong, sharp instrument,
      like the pickaxe. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was visible down below, and up above it grew steadily darker.
      Whether the water below was rising higher in the pit or not they were
      unable to find out from actual sight, but they had a full conviction that
      it was steadily advancing higher and higher towards them, and that with
      its advance it was also unsettling or sapping away altogether the sides of
      the pit. Awful were the moments, and terrible the forebodings. The
      darkness intensified every fear, and made the actual dangers by which they
      were surrounded still more formidable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overhead they could see the shadowy form of the broken beam still hanging,
      and still threatening to fall at any moment. The rope fastened to it had
      broken below the point where they were seated, and was within reach of
      their hands; but it was of no use. Had the beam above been strong, they
      could have easily saved themselves in this way; but the beam being broken,
      they dared not touch the rope. The terror of the broken beam was, however,
      lost sight of in the presence of that greater terror advancing from below,
      minute by minute&mdash;the terror of that water into whose mysterious
      sources they had penetrated; whose secret fountain they had broken up, and
      which now, like some formidable monster too rashly challenged, was
      advancing step by step, in irresistible power, to take vengeance upon
      these reckless intruders. That soil beneath had shown its looseness by
      tumbling down in the removal of the lower logs; the tenacious upper clay
      did not exist there; and it seemed to them that the rising water, by
      permeating all the soil, might at any moment cause all the pit to fail
      together in one heap of undistinguishable ruin. In that case, they would
      be overwhelmed beyond the possibility of escape, and snatched from the
      world to destruction, without leaving behind them the faintest vestige, or
      the slightest token of their awful fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      At such a moment nothing was said. Nothing could be said. They sat there
      then in silence, listening with sharpened senses for any sound that might
      tell of the approach of the water. For a long time, however, they heard
      nothing except the quick throbbing of their own hearts, until, at last,
      there gradually came up a dull sound, which slowly resolved itself into
      something like thumping and grinding.
    </p>
    <p>
      They listened now with intense excitement and agitation to these sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were they?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one meaning which they were able to give to them. It seemed
      as if these sounds must indicate the breaking up of the lower casing of
      logs that lined the pit&mdash;the first notice sent them of that break-up
      which was inevitable. Every sound seemed to tell of some new log severed
      from its place by the pressure of the surrounding soil, which, now
      saturated with water, and transformed to a sort of ooze, streamed through
      the crannies, and destroyed the staying of the pit. At this thought the
      expectation of the end grew stronger, their awful doom seemed more
      immediate, and every nerve tingled, and every fibre of their being
      thrilled with a sense of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat with their legs hanging over, and their hands grasping the log
      beneath as firmly as they could. It was while they were in this position
      that Bart felt something strike his foot. At that touch his first impulse
      made him shrink back in terror, and jerk both feet into the air. The same
      moment Pat felt the same, and evinced the same repugnance by a similar
      gesture. A moment&rsquo;s thought, however, served to show Bart what it might
      be; so, reaching his feet down as far as he could in order to test it, he
      found that his suspicions were correct, and that the water had risen to
      that point. What had touched his foot was a log that had floated on the
      top of the rising water.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were more than one log, and this was the discovery that Bart
      made; and these logs were a dense mass that filled the pit, and were
      carried up by the water in this way. They had loosened many logs at the
      bottom, and had stood the long ones upright, while the shorter ones lay
      lengthwise. It was in about this same position that the mass of logs now
      floated up, and reached the place where they could be touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment a joyful cry escaped Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were safe! we&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo; cried Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the first words that had been spoken since Pat first announced
      the entrance of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe, is it?&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know how, so I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, these logs; only feel with your feet, Pat. They&rsquo;re all floating up.
      I never thought of that. Only feel how compact and solid they are. They&rsquo;ll
      bear our weight, and we can float up with them.&rdquo; Pat for a moment made no
      remark, but reached out his feet, and felt as far as he could. Then a cry
      of joy burst from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huroo!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;By the powers! but it&rsquo;s safe we are. Sure it&rsquo;s as
      solid as a flure, so it is. It&rsquo;s a raft that we have, and it&rsquo;ll float us
      as high as it goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if it don&rsquo;t cave in first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cave in, is it? O, sure but it won&rsquo;t be likely to cave in up here at all
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better lie along at full length.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An what&rsquo;ll we do that for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, so as to get the advantage of the floating power of all the logs. If
      we stand on one or two they&rsquo;ll sink down at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an that&rsquo;s so. It&rsquo;s right you are, so it is. We&rsquo;ll lie down at full
      lingth; an O, don&rsquo;t I wish we could take a bit of a nap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t think of that, Pat; we&rsquo;ve got lots to do yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nappin? me nappin? Sure it&rsquo;s only funnin I wor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, we need only to float up to the plank casing. Then we&rsquo;ll be
      all right. And it seems to be coming up pretty fast. It&rsquo;s risen a foot
      already, since we first felt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it has, sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better be getting ready. I&rsquo;ll drop off first, and roll over to the
      other side, and hold on to as many as I can, and then you come along after
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit, sure, till it gits a few inches higher. It&rsquo;ll be up fast
      enough, sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys now waited in silence for a little while longer. The water rose
      steadily, bearing up the mass of logs on their surface. At length, slowly
      and cautiously, Bart allowed himself to pass upon the logs, and to his
      immense delight, found that they supported his weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah, Pat!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re as solid as a rock. Come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments Pat was by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;that they would be so solid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor me ayther,&rdquo; said Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what it is. The logs were stood upright, and as they floated
      up from the ground, they were turned in all directions, and got so mixed
      up, that each one supported the other, and the short logs have got mixed
      up with the long ones; and so it&rsquo;s just like a regular raft, and they bear
      us as well as if they&rsquo;d all been laid crosswise on purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrue for you,&rdquo; said Pat; &ldquo;an if it&rsquo;s so solid, I don&rsquo;t see why we
      mightn&rsquo;t stand up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we&rsquo;d better not. This is the safest way. We might jar them, or shake
      them by putting too much weight on one spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s best not to be in too big a hurry,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;an let well
      enough alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys now relapsed into silence, and watched anxiously their progress.
      By feeling the logs on the sides of the pit, they could perceive that they
      were rising at a rate that was very satisfactory. Inch after inch slipped
      away from their fingers; log after log on the sides was covered by the
      rising water. And at intervals, as they looked up to measure their
      distance from the top, they could see that it was steadily diminishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the hope which had arisen within them did not blind them to the danger
      that still surrounded them. Still there was the danger of the broken log.
      The rope hung down, and never ceased to remind them, as they rose, that
      there was this above them, for the rope coiled itself over them, and they
      feared to make the slightest movement, lest they might give it a pull.
      Another danger was the chance that the pit might cave in, from having its
      foundations more and more sapped by the water. This danger had been
      delayed for long, but the longer the time was, the greater the danger
      grew. But most of all they feared lest the supply of water might cease
      before they reached the plank casing. If these waters came from the level
      of the sea, they would not rise in the pit higher than that level; and
      whether that would bring them as high as the plank casing, they could not
      tell. Their chief hope arose from the landlord&rsquo;s statement that the island
      was not more than thirty feet above the water, and if this was so, they
      knew that they might get to within thirty feet of the top. And the plank
      casing came down about as far as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, full of hope and fear, which thus alternated, they floated up,
      rising higher and higher every minute, and feeling most carefully all the
      while in order to note the progress which they made. At length the
      progress grew somewhat slower, and hope began to grow faint; still, as it
      did actually continue, they struggled against despondency, and looked
      upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their progress now grew slower. It seemed as though the force which
      pressed the waters on was being gradually exhausted. Was this because that
      water came from some internal reservoir, or because they had now reached a
      point almost at the level of the sea? They were not high enough yet, and
      they were not rising fast enough for their impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart now stood up and felt. They were near to the lowest part of the plank
      casing, yet not near enough. Would they ever get nearer? At the rate at
      which they were now rising, they could scarcely hope to rise more than one
      other foot at the farthest. And the plank casing was four feet, at least,
      above his head&mdash;quite out of his reach. What then? Must they lie down
      here and perish almost within reach of safety? For a few moments it seemed
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was only for a few moments. Suddenly the problem was solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pat,&rdquo; cried Bart, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand here. You climb up till you get your feet
      on my shoulders. You can reach the planking then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how&rsquo;ll you git up yourself?&rdquo; asked Pat, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, when you git up, you can throw me that rope, of course,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough. Och, but it&rsquo;s the fool I am, sure, not to think of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No more words were spoken. Pat did as Bart told him, climbing till his
      feet rested on Bart&rsquo;s shoulders. The lowest line of planks was within
      reach. Here he found a place to grasp with his hands, the logs below
      affording sufficient foothold. He found no difficulty. It was almost like
      going up a ladder now, and in a few moments he was at the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all danger was not yet over. He dared not touch the broken log, and
      could not detach the rope without doing so. As the log was, it seemed to
      be hanging by a few fibres, and the slightest touch might send it down.
      But there were plenty of ropes at the hut, and he at once hurried away to
      procure one. He brought back one which was quite new, and therefore strong
      enough; and also a crowbar. Driving the crowbar into the ground, he bound
      the rope to it, and flung the end down to Bart, who had been waiting
      patiently in the mean time. Pat now held the crowbar to steady it, and
      Bart, seizing the rope, raised himself up. A slight effort was sufficient
      to bring him up to within reach of the plank casing, and for the rest of
      the way it was easy enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last! There they stood, those two, who had of late been in such deep
      and dark despair. They stood there, drawing deep breaths of that glad
      upper air, and looked around. The moon shone from on high, throwing its
      lustre over the scene, and pouring upon the sea a silver flood. Joy and
      gratitude overwhelmed them, and with one common impulse they fell upon
      their kne&rsquo;es, and gave thanks to that Merciful One who had drawn them up
      &ldquo;out of a horrible pit,&rdquo; and restored them to the light of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their excitement and their labor had utterly exhausted them in mind
      and body. They were terribly fatigued. To row back to Chester was
      impossible. They therefore went off at once to the little hut, and here,
      flinging themselves upon the floor, they soon sank into a profound
      slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the boys, with the landlord, and Roach, had searched about the
      island, until the minds of all were, filled with the deepest anxiety. The
      hut still remained, and into this, not expecting to find anything, yet
      still anxious to search everywhere, they all went. There was an outer room
      full of ropes and tools, passing through which they came to an inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of a profound slumber Bart and Pat were abruptly roused, and opened
      their eyes to find themselves surrounded by their four companions,
      perfectly frantic with excitement and joy, together with two strangers,
      the landlord and the man who had shown them the way, which two exhibited a
      most profound emotion. After their first bewilderment, Bart and Pat found
      it easy to guess at the meaning of this scene, and the memories which they
      had of their terrible adventure fully justified in their eyes the wild joy
      of their friends. It was a comfort to them to perceive that they had thus
      been promptly followed, for they saw that had they not been able to get
      out of the hole, they would have been rescued by these loving hands before
      all was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long explanations were deferred for the present. Bart and Pat were in a
      state of starvation, and their friends had forgotten to bring any food.
      But Chester was not far away. The wind was fair, and before very long they
      were all seated at the inn table, where the two lost ones satisfied their
      ravenous appetites, and the other boys made a second breakfast, which was
      more satisfactory than the first had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      After which Bart and Pat told the whole story minutely, answering every
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wonder, the anxiety, and the horror that were manifested by the
      hearers during this narrative need not be described here. Roach insisted
      that it was all the doings of Kidd, and maintained that life must yet be
      sacrificed, before the malign spirits would be appeased, and surrender the
      treasure. The landlord, on the contrary, rightly viewed it as utter
      recklessness on the part of the boys. The previous diggers had several
      times broken into what he called the &ldquo;drain,&rdquo; and the boys had done the
      same thing, and so he declared all would do, till they should organize the
      new company, and set up a steam engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here it may be as well to state that the new joint stock company was
      afterwards organized, and the steam engine set up, and a regular series of
      engineering experiments carried out. Coffer dams were constructed on the
      shore, and ever so many new pits were dug in many different places. In
      spite of all, however, the new company was a total failure; the waters of
      the sea proved stronger than their puny arms; and the place known as the
      original money-hole was never reached. Scientific men laughed at the
      theory of Kidd&rsquo;s treasure, and the drain, as all moonshine, and said that
      the company might as well try to dig pits in a quicksand; but the
      stockholders clung to their faith even after they had failed, and to this
      day talk about the &ldquo;treasure,&rdquo; the &ldquo;money-hole,&rdquo; the &ldquo;chest,&rdquo; and the
      &ldquo;drain,&rdquo; as though they were all solid and well-established facts.

      of the party in the Antelope had neither heard of the peril of Bart and
      Pat, nor known of their escape from it; and to these it was that the
      information of these things came last of all, yet not with the least
      profound effect. To Solomon the theory of the man Roach seemed
      unanswerable, and the very mention of it made his eyes roll about till
      nothing was visible except two revolving white disks on an ebon ground.
      His fingers clasped one another nervously, and his jaw fell and remained
      hanging, as though the owner of it had no further use for it, or had lost
      all control of it. From Solomon&rsquo;s former actions on different occasions,
      he had given indications of a nature that was not untinged with
      superstition, and a fancy that was ready to kindle and flame up with all
      those visions of the supernatural which seem so congenial to the negro
      mind. </span>

      &ldquo;O, de sakes alive!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;An under neaf de groun&mdash;an back
      agin safe! What! down below dar to dat ar place! Clar, if it don&rsquo;t make
      dis yer ole man go nigh stracted to think of. On dat ar island, down in
      dat ar hole, dar&rsquo;s a hull slew of ghosts an hobblegobblums ob de wustest
      sort ob pirates an murderers all lyin in wait, wid de ole boy himself, an
      a watchin ober de treasure. How ebber youns managed to git out ob de
      clutches ob dem dar hobblegobblums beats me&mdash;does so. Clar, if I
      ain&rsquo;t mos &rsquo;fraid to think ob it. Darsn&rsquo;t&mdash;no how. Ef I&rsquo;d ben
      down dar, I&rsquo;d gon mad wid fright. But dar couldn&rsquo;t be any danger ob me
      ebber goin down&mdash;no, sah! You may bet high on dat ar. Not for all de
      treasure dat Cap&rsquo;n Kidd ebber buried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet heard the harrowing story with a face full of sickening
      suspense and terrible anxiety. In his gentle and affectionate nature he
      seemed to suffer all that the boys had suffered. He made no remark
      whatever, and after it was all told, he remained in silence for some time,
      looking, in an abstracted way, at vacancy. The others respected his
      evident emotion, and stood regarding him in solemn silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he raised his venerable head, and surveyed Bart and Pat with an
      impressive gaze; after which he looked at each of the other boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well!&rdquo; he said, slowly, and with emphasis; &ldquo;had I a knowed&mdash;had
      I a thought&mdash;had I a s&rsquo;posed&mdash;had I a dreampt of the
      possee-bility of this, I&rsquo;d never a ventoored into any harbure till I cud
      anchor opposite my natyve hum. An I might have expected it&mdash;tew. I
      know how it allus was, an might have expected how it allus was a goin for
      to be. But this here does clap the climax. And whuffore? What upon airth
      possessed you to ventoor down under ground on a broken rope, hangin from a
      rotten beam? Why, it won&rsquo;t bar a thinkin on. It&rsquo;s wuss than anythin that&rsquo;s
      happened among all that long an eventfuel serious of misfort&rsquo;ns an
      clamties that&rsquo;s ben a befallin of us ever sence we fust assembled together
      on board this here schewner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now what am I a goin to do? Do? Me? Why, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;m a
      goin to do. I&rsquo;m a goin to take up a bee-line for hum, an never enter
      another harbure&mdash;no, not so much as look at one, till I get to the
      wharf at Grand Pré. This responsibility is tew, tew kerushin. I ain&rsquo;t a
      stick, an I ain&rsquo;t a stun, an I can&rsquo;t abear it. A human heart beats in this
      aged boosum, an it&rsquo;s ben wrung on-common. I don&rsquo;t want to get another
      squinge. No&mdash;not me. An so I intend this day to hist anchor, an
      spread my sail to catch the gale. An them, that wants to go hum by land
      air at liberty so to do&mdash;an peace an joy go with em; but them as
      wishes to stand by the ship &lsquo;ll be welcome to the aged Corbet, an make his
      path of life all the brighter for their presence. An, so sayin, I&rsquo;ll
      kinclewd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conclusion, thus announced, was one which the boys were not unwilling
      to accept. There was nothing more here which they particularly cared to
      see. After the adventure of Bart and Pat, the treasure of the seas and the
      plunder of the Spanish Main lost that dazzling and alluring charm which
      hitherto had been found in those sounding words. The fact that it was so
      inaccessible was of itself sufficient to quell their ardor; but, more than
      this, they were affected by the information of past attempts to get at the
      treasure, and especially by the present efforts at forming a joint stock
      company. This at once vulgarized the whole affair. It put it into the
      hands of every one. It made it a matter of shares and shafts, engineers
      and steam-engines. With such things as these the boys felt they had
      nothing to do, and in them they took no interest whatever. Then, finally,
      the adventure of Bart and Pat had so exhausted the possibilities of
      Ma-hone Bay, that they could hope for nothing which could surpass it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequence was, that, not long after the happy return of Bart and
      Pat, the Antelope once more set sail. The wind was fair, and the ship was
      ready. The landlord and Roach watched them as they moved away, and waved
      their hats after them as they passed down the harbor. And so the Antelope
      went away, leaving behind her, in its resting-place, undisturbed, the
      treasure of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day the wind continued fair from the north-west, and all the
      night following. The Antelope made a good run, and it was hoped that now
      they might reach their destination without any further trouble; but, on
      the following day, they found that these hopes were premature, and that
      trials yet awaited them; for, on going to the deck, they saw, all around,
      and above, and beneath, their old enemy&mdash;the enemy that they detested&mdash;the
      fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the fog was upon them&mdash;like some stealthy, vigilant, inexorable
      foe, who, finding them thus setting forth on their last voyage for home,
      now advanced upon them from all sides, to assail them for the last time.
      Bruce saw this first, and groaned. Arthur groaned likewise. So did Tom and
      Phil. And so did Bart and Pat. As for Solomon, he took no notice of it
      whatever, but devoted himself, as usual, to his pots and pans, while
      Captain Corbet had far too philosophical a soul, and far too much
      experience of such a situation, to be disturbed in the slightest degree by
      so commonplace a matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; said Bruce, after a long and most unhappy silence,
      which told more eloquently than words their opinions as to this last
      mischance. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might have expected it,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;judging from the past. We&rsquo;ve
      had enough of it to make it seem natural. Still, I didn&rsquo;t expect it, I
      must say, any more than you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;I had forgotten all about it, and thought that
      the Atlantic Ocean would be like Mahone Bay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we had left the Antelope,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;and gone off by land, as
      Captain Corbet advised, either to Grand Pré, or anywhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, sure an it&rsquo;ll blow over, so it will,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;Not it.&rdquo;,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it&rsquo;s best to be afther lookin on the bright side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any bright side to the fog that I could ever see,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to do as we&rsquo;ve done before&mdash;grin and
      bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a great deal harder to grin now than it used to be,&rdquo; said Phil,
      plaintively; &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t bear it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well, Captain Corbet&rsquo;ll work his way along. He understands fog, at any
      rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t altogether think so,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;After losing himself so
      utterly a few days ago, and fetching up at Sable Island, I rather begin to
      doubt his power to understand fog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well, that was in a strange place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is a strange place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite. We are getting well on towards the Bay of Fundy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re not there yet. As yet, we&rsquo;re in the Atlantic Ocean. Now,
      Captain Corbet got lost once before in this same place,&mdash;the Atlantic
      Ocean,&mdash;and it&rsquo;s my fixed belief that he&rsquo;ll do it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we know where the coast of Nova Scotia is now, and we&rsquo;re all right.
      I&rsquo;m determined to look on the bright side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and I&rsquo;m determined to be prepared for the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The event showed that this fog did not have a bright side, and that it was
      wiser, in these circumstances, to be prepared for the worst. That day
      passed, and the fog still held on. The wind that brought the fog was
      strong, steady, and sustained, showing neither violence nor irresolution,
      but blowing in a way that promised to last long after their stock of
      patience was exhausted. It was a sou&rsquo;-wester, the wind of fog and storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      After another day had passed, Captain Corbet&rsquo;s face assumed an expression,
      the meaning of which was but too well known to all the boys through sad
      experience. That meaning was, that he was puzzled, that he was uncertain,
      hesitating, and not decided where to go. And the boys discussed this among
      themselves, and perceived that once again their good, their venerable,
      their modest, but, after all, somewhat incapable commander had again lost
      his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see,&rdquo; said he to Bruce, who mentioned this to him in a mild way,&mdash;&ldquo;ye
      see thar&rsquo;s ben so much tackin backard an forard that I kine o; got out o&rsquo;
      the knack of it, an thar&rsquo;s a kink or two in my cal&rsquo;lations. Ef we hadn&rsquo;t
      got to alius beat up agin this sou&rsquo;-wester, we&rsquo;d manage to keep a better
      course; but, as it is, we ain&rsquo;t got no course in pa&rsquo;ticular, wuth
      mentionin. An then thar&rsquo;s them tides, an currents, an all that; an what
      with them, an tackin, an the fog, why, it&rsquo;s got to be precious hard
      navigatin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t you keep well in to the Nova Scotia shore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, that thar&rsquo;s the very identical thing I&rsquo;m a drivin at, an I dar say,
      if the fog was to lift, you&rsquo;d see it quite handy over thar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are we now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, as nigh as I can cal&rsquo;clate, we&rsquo;ve about got to the end of Nova
      Scotia; an I&rsquo;ve a mind to take a long tack to the nothe-west, next turn,
      an hain&rsquo;t got no reasonable doubt but what we&rsquo;ll keep on till we fetch up
      in old Fundy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this was rather disheartening to the boys. They saw that Captain
      Corbet did not even profess to have any exact knowledge of his position,
      and, judging from the past, they did not believe that he had any. Still,
      the change of course which he announced was something, and it seemed to
      afford some slight material for hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the Antelope came round on her next tack, and, taking a
      north-west course, she kept it for some time. At first the captain was
      rather watchful; but, after three or four hours, his vigilance began to
      relax, and at length he ventured to announce to the boys that they must be
      in the Bay of Fundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An when I&rsquo;m here, in this Bay o&rsquo; Fundy, boys, mind you,&rdquo; said he, with
      something of exultation in his tone,&mdash;&ldquo;when I&rsquo;m here, why, I&rsquo;m to
      hum. These waters was the place whar I sported in boyhood&rsquo;s days. Here I
      matoored into a man. Here I&rsquo;ve held commoon with the ragin biller, an rode
      on the kerest of the toomultus ocean. You can&rsquo;t disturb me when I&rsquo;m in old
      Fundy. It&rsquo;s my hum. Fog an tide hev ben my companions from childhood, an
      the Bay of Fundy recognizes in the aged Corbet her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But what he was going to say was never said, for the word was taken out of
      his mouth, and exchanged for the interjection,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Antelope had come to a sudden stop. The shock was strong enough to
      knock Captain Corbet on his knees, and huddle all the boys together in a
      startled and struggling crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant Corbet was on his feet, and rushed forward to see what was
      the matter. The boys followed. The helm was left to take care of itself,
      and the sails snapped and fluttered in the wind. All was confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I do believe,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;I do rail-ly believe she&rsquo;s struck!
      Dear me! Wal, I never! This&mdash;doo&mdash;beat&mdash;my&mdash;grandmother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This allusion to his grandmother, under such circumstances, far from
      reassuring the boys, only excited their alarm the more, and made them
      think that their revered commander had lost his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; cried Bruce, &ldquo;the Antelope&rsquo;s struck, and is sinking. We&rsquo;ll have to
      take to the boat. I&rsquo;ll fill a keg of water. The rest of you gather a
      supply of biscuit for a week, and one of you bring the compass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no; don&rsquo;t trouble yourselves,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;not&mdash;the
      slightest conse-kence. Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But these and other words were lost on the boys, who, now in the full
      conviction that the Antelope was sinking, hurried to do as Bruce had told
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tom and Pat held back. Pat rushed to the mainmast, and busied himself
      with some ropes; and Tom went to the pump, and, after taking a peep into
      the hold, began pumping.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a minute or so he called out,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, boys, there&rsquo;s no hurry. There&rsquo;s no water in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words made the others desist from their preparations. Seeing Tom
      pumping, it struck them all that this was better than taking to the boat;
      so they all hurried to his help. As yet, however, there was nothing to be
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, thar&rsquo;s no danger in p&rsquo;tic&rsquo;lar,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s struck a
      sand-bank, paps, or, paps, a reef, somewhars. An now I wonder whar it can
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this remark, which showed his utter ignorance of the situation, the
      boys had no reply to make. Bruce, however, tied an iron belaying-pin to a
      rope, and began sounding for bottom. At the stern he found three fathoms,
      at the bows only three feet. He took a boat-hook, and, plunging it down
      into the water at the bows, found that it was smooth sand, and the bows
      were resting upon it. This gave some comfort, for he hoped that they might
      yet escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the wind was strong, and the waves made the Antelope roll and work
      about in her sandy bed after a most unpleasant fashion. If this continued
      long, the boys knew that the schooner would be lost, for she could not
      resist such a strain as this. Still, they turned their thoughts now rather
      to the task of saving her, if possible, than taking to the boat; and so,
      lowering the sails, so as to lessen the effect of the wind upon her, they
      set to work, some with the sweeps rowing, and others with the boat-hook
      pushing, and thus they tried to get her off the sand-bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the best thing we can do,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, in a
      patronizing tone; &ldquo;an we&rsquo;ll do it yet. An I dare say the tide&rsquo;ll lift us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This mention of the tide cheered the boys. If the tide was rising, they
      could hope; if not, it would be bad for them. A little calculation showed
      them that it could not be falling, but must be rising, and this discovery
      made them work with renewed energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they had the satisfaction of finding that their efforts were
      successful. The water at the bows deepened; the schooner moved. She was
      afloat! Quickly the sails were hoisted, and the Antelope, catching the
      wind, came round, and once more sought the deep water.

      deep water, their troubles were not yet over, for others soon arose almost
      as grave as the one from which they had just escaped. First of all, the
      uncertainty of Captain Corbet as to his position had evidently returned.
      He had that expression of concern, bewilderment, and confusion which shows
      a puzzled mind. He said nothing, but, after about a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s
      run, brought the Antelope about, and went on another tack. And now the
      wind, which all day had been rather fresh, began to lessen more and more,
      until after about a couple of hours it had almost died away. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time Solomon had been on deck. He had come up when the Antelope
      struck, and had worked away with the rest in their efforts in getting her
      off. Afterwards he had remained, out of a natural feeling of curiosity, to
      see whether any more rocks or sand-banks were to be encountered. This
      danger, however, now seemed to have passed away, and Solomon became
      mindful of the duties of a cook. He therefore went below to prepare the
      evening&rsquo;s repast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he done so, than he bounded up again out of the hold upon
      deck. His eyes were staring, his jaw dropped, and if his black face could
      have shown anything like pallor, it would have done so at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Da-da-da-dars&mdash;a&mdash;leak. Da-da-dars a foot of water down below!&rdquo;
       he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0255.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      At this astounding and alarming intelligence the boys rushed down into the
      hold. Solomon&rsquo;s information was right. Over the floor there was as much as
      six inches of water, and everything that lay there was saturated.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once the whole truth flashed upon them. The Antelope had rolled and
      twisted herself on the sand-bank so much, that her timbers and planks had
      been opened, and a dangerous leak had been established. It was not a
      broken place, or a hole that could be stopped up, but evidently some
      general leakage arising from the strain to which she had been subjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      This served, in the opinion of all, to fill up the measure of their
      troubles. Bad enough it was to be enclosed in the fog; bad enough to be
      without any knowledge of their situation; bad enough to be in the viciuity
      of dangerous shoals, and perhaps rocks; but in addition to all this, to
      have their vessel leaking, this indeed was a thing which might well cause
      despair. And accordingly at the first sight of the water in the hold,
      every one of them stood as if paralyzed, and looked on motionless and in
      dead silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart was the first to break the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, boys,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve every one of us been in worse scrapes than
      this. After being on a water-logged ship, we oughtn&rsquo;t to care for a few
      inches of water. Let&rsquo;s go to the pump, and see if we can&rsquo;t get rid of
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, Bart leaped up to the deck, and sprang to the pump, followed
      by all the others. Only two of them could work at a time. Bart and Phil
      worked away first, till they were exhausted. Then Arthur and Pat took
      hold, and were relieved by Bruce and Tom. They worked vigorously, and with
      a will, in all the freshness, too, of their first efforts. Every one of
      them had a confident expectation that this labor would be successful, and
      that a half an hour, at the farthest, would be enough to pump the schooner
      dry. But a half hour passed, and yet that result was not accomplished.
      There was a difference certainly, but not anything like what they had
      wished. Judging from the amount of labor that they had put forth in this
      half hour, and the slight result, they were filled with dismay at the
      prospect before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;it ain&rsquo;t what we expected; but I dare say we expected
      too much. Perhaps we ought to be satisfied if we find that we can keep the
      water under.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can we do it?&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we can. Haven&rsquo;t we been doing it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have&mdash;certainly. But how long can we keep at this sort of work?
      Why, the pump&rsquo;ll have to be kept going day and night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wade and Solomon now went to work; but their efforts made no very
      perceptible diminution in the water in addition to what had already taken
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;that the leak gets steadily worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, because Solomon and Wade don&rsquo;t do more than any two of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, they don&rsquo;t work with such a will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. But in pumping, I dare say steady efforts like theirs amount
      to as much at least as our quick way of working; and besides, they&rsquo;re
      stronger, and ought to do more. I think the leak is worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it took about two hours for the water to come in that&rsquo;s in her now.
      If it had been coming in so slowly as that, we would have pumped her dry
      by this time. But the fact is, the more we pump, the faster the water
      comes in. I think it is working its way through new seams and crevices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no further reply to this; but not long afterwards, when Bruce
      and Tom had pumped with unusual vigor, they examined the hold once more.
      They found about six inches of water. The water had gained therefore. It
      had come back to the amount which had been there when they first began.
      These last efforts had gained nothing. In spite of all the water that had
      been poured out over the side, the quantity below was the same. There was
      no longer the slightest doubt that the leak was increasing, and that, too,
      with a rapidity that was very alarming. And while the leak thus gained
      power, their own efforts could not possibly increase beyond what they had
      already been, but, as a matter of course, would, on the contrary, rather
      decrease. And yet there was nothing else to be done but to pump on, for if
      they relinquished their efforts, they were lost. So they kept at it,
      taking turns as before, and while any two were at the pump, the others
      occupied themselves with watching the water beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the intervals, Solomon prepared the evening meal. It was later
      than usual, and any other than he would have omitted it altogether. But
      Solomon knew too well its importance, and felt that now it was, perhaps,
      of more importance than ever. The boys also, in the intervals which they
      had, prepared provisions for the boat. They put in oars, the boat&rsquo;s mast
      and sail, two kegs of water; amounting to about twenty gallons, a barrel
      of biscuit, a ham, and a few other articles. In this way they endeavored
      to prepare themselves for the worst, and to have everything ready when the
      critical moment should arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time Captain Corbet was mooning at the helm. He occasionally
      offered a remark, of which, however, no heed was taken by the busy
      company. They had something else to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef I&rsquo;d ony a come straight along from Bosting,&rdquo; said he, on one of those
      occasions,&mdash;&ldquo;ef I now at this moment was a navigatin from Bosting,
      I&rsquo;d know whar I be. For I never know that I ever did lose my reckonin on
      one of them thar vyges. But comin up in this here roundabout circuous way
      from them outlandish seas, made me kine o&rsquo; git everythin upset and jumbled
      together in my old head. An now where air we? &rsquo;Tis a pint I long to
      know. Blest if I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be pleased,&rdquo; he continued, in a meditative tone, &ldquo;to find out
      what course is the best for us jest now; though for that matter thar ain&rsquo;t
      overly much wind, and I don&rsquo;t seem to see how we could sail anywhars, even
      ef we wanted to go, an knowed jest the pint to go to. But as soon&rsquo;s the
      wind does rise, I have an idee of the course I&rsquo;m goin to take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Bart, who happened to be near and hear this last
      remark. It seemed to him a good sign that Captain Corbet should have any
      theory now about his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, &ldquo;it kine o&rsquo; seems to me as if the best way
      would be to head her nothe-east. We can&rsquo;t head her nothe agin in this fog;
      r&rsquo;else we&rsquo;ll hit another rock; but ef we keep her nothe-east, we may dodge
      the rocks, an fetch up somewhars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this utterly vague and unsatisfactory statement Bart turned away, more
      disheartened than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night the boys took turns till about midnight, when they all turned
      in, leaving Solomon, Wade, and the captain to take turns pumping till
      morning. The wind had gone down almost altogether, and the sea was quite
      smooth. The water in the hold remained at about the same level; and when
      the boys turned in, they had a feeling of satisfaction at this, or they
      would have had, if they had not been so completely worn out. Their
      sleeping-place was not their usual one. The water had driven them out.
      They brought their mattresses on deck, rolled themselves up in blankets,
      and curled up there the best way they could. So they passed the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day they awaked early. There was a moderate breeze, and
      the Antelope was making some progress running before it. But the fog still
      continued, and environed them on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this, however, they took no note just then. Their first thought was
      about the leak. They saw Wade working away at the pump in that dull,
      mechanical fashion which distinguished him in everything that he did. They
      said nothing to him, but at once looked into the hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight that they saw there confirmed their worst fears. The water had
      increased during the night, and they saw at once that either the leak had
      grown worse, or else that the pumping had been neglected. Things did not
      look well either for them or for the Antelope..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all ben a takin of our turn thro the night,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet,
      who was, as usual, at the helm. &ldquo;It seems to be considerable of a leak.
      But I dar say we&rsquo;ll manage to keep it down. The Antelope hadn&rsquo;t ought to
      be a leaky vessel either. I&rsquo;ve alius took good car of her. But it&rsquo;s that
      strain she got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a foot of water, at least,&rdquo; cried Bart, &ldquo;over the floor.
      There must be over two feet of water in the hold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full that,&rdquo; said Arthur, gravely. &ldquo;At this rate we&rsquo;ll have to take to the
      boat before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, thar&rsquo;s no hurry,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet; &ldquo;the old Antelope&rsquo;s dreadful
      perseverin, and a tremen-jous hand at keepin afloat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;I rather think we may fight off the water to-day, at
      any rate, and the fog may lift before night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better not take to the boat till the last moment.
      I&rsquo;d rather be here taking my turn at the pump, than off in the boat, not
      knowing where we are or where we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it&rsquo;s a pity there wasn&rsquo;t another pump,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;We cud do
      double the work, so we cud. An I&rsquo;d be proud to take me turrun at the pump
      twice as often, so I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what, boys,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Some of us might bale out with pails,
      while we&rsquo;re not pumping. I wish I could construct a siphon; but I suppose
      it couldn&rsquo;t be managed; so let&rsquo;s bale. Two at the pump, and the rest at
      pails. That ought to be equal to two pumps, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an it&rsquo;ll be aqual to fower pumps, so it will, if we work hard
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This proposal was excellent in its way, only there was a doubt as to
      whether they could muster four pails. After some search two were found,
      and Solomon produced a tin kettle. This made three. Pat then brought forth
      a coal scuttle, which was well adapted for the work. With these increased
      resources they now set to work. Jumping down into the hold, four of them
      baled out the water, and poured it upon the deck, from which it ran into
      the sea. They worked at this most zealously and most industriously for two
      hours. At the end of that time they were all utterly exhausted. They had
      taken turns at the pump and at the pails, and the continuous work without
      rest had told most severely upon them all. They all felt that this would
      utterly use them up, if persisted in much longer. At the same time they
      had the satisfaction of seeing a perceptible diminution in the water,
      though by no means as much as they had hoped to find; and they all felt as
      though they had not received an adequate reward for such exhaustive
      labors. They saw that if they hoped to continue at the pump, it was
      absolutely necessary to give up the baling, and rest until the turn of
      each should come. And so the baling was given up.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hasty breakfast was taken. Solomon had to give up his work as cook, and
      take his turn at the pump, and therefore every one had to forage for
      himself. Already, however, Solomon had taken the precaution to remove the
      stores from the hold and cabin up to the deck, where they would be out of
      the reach of the water, at least as long as the schooner could pretend to
      float. Out of these stores each one could now supply himself whenever and
      however he might feel inclined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having given up the idea of baling, the boys, in the intervals of taking
      turn at the pump, had nothing else to do now than to gather up strength
      for a new effort. While so doing, they watched the state of the water in
      the hold; or tried to penetrate the veil of fog that hung around; or
      listened, hoping to hear some sound that might tell of ships in their
      neighborhood. Sometimes, also, they sounded on the &ldquo;fog-horn&rdquo; of the
      Antelope&mdash;a peculiar tin trumpet with which every Down East coaster
      or fisher is provided, and which makes the most unearthly sound that has
      ever been contrived by man, not even excepting the yell of an asthmatic
      steam whistle. But looking, and listening, and sounding on the trumpet
      were alike unavailing, for no sight, or sound, or answering note of any
      kind came to them through that wall of mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was depressing. The fog was depressing. The fact that they had
      lost their way was depressing. But most of all, their own exertions proved
      depressing, for those exertions seemed unavailing. Still the waters crept
      ahead of them. They were not able to hold their own. After their vigorous
      and exhaustive efforts at baling, the water, held at bay for a time, came
      back to the assault, and this time it triumphed over the pump, and rose
      slowly, yet steadily. By the close of the day the water in the hold was
      enough to startle even the phlegmatic Wade. That personage had taken some
      sleep during the afternoon, after a long tug at the pump, and had snoozed
      away as calmly as an infant until sunset. On waking he walked to the hold,
      and looked down. The sight was by no means reassuring. Nearly two feet of
      water rolled backward and forward at the motion of the Antelope. He shook
      his phlegmatic, unexcitable, undemonstrative head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Wade,&rdquo; he said, speaking as if to himself. &ldquo;An my old &rsquo;oman&rsquo;s
      name&rsquo;s Gipson. An you&rsquo;ll not find many o&rsquo; that name in this country. No,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took another look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again his head gave a solemn and portentous shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said once more,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the pump went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      And pump struggled with sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sea gained!

      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>IGHT came&mdash;a
      miserable&mdash;miserable night! On the previous night, the boys had
      slept; but this night, sleep was not thought of by any one of them.
      Exhausted though they all were by hard work, they yet felt the position of
      the Antelope to be too perilous to think of sleep. It was a time for
      vigilance. It was a time when each one had to keep himself wide awake, and
      hold himself prepared to rush to the boat at a moment&rsquo;s warning. The boat
      floated astern, as usual, and in it were all the stores that might be
      necessary for a lengthened row; but they wished to postpone any recourse
      to this boat to the latest possible moment. And all the time the Antelope
      held on her course, impelled by a fair, yet moderate breeze, that blew
      directly astern. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Exhausted though they were, yet none of them shrunk from his task. All
      took turns. Corbet and Wade, Wade and Solomon, Corbet and Solomon; then
      the boys, two by two, at the pump; each couple laboring strenuously and
      conscientiously, yet showing the same result. For, whoever it was that
      worked, or whatever was the amount of labor expended, the result seemed in
      each case a failure and a defeat. They were struggling against a common
      enemy; but the enemy was gaining. In spite of their efforts, the waters
      continued to rise, and there was no way by which they could bring any
      additional labor to bear. Had there been another pump, they would have
      been in a better position. At about midnight they undertook a second time
      to supplement the pumping with baling, but again desisted on account of
      the utter exhaustion which followed such severe toil. It only lessened
      their power of working at the pump. So once more they gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time on their efforts grew less and less. The long toil had told
      upon every one of them, more particularly upon the boys. The labors of
      Captain Corbet, of Solomon, and of Wade, were less vigorous certainly; yet
      still, they were even and well sustained; but those of the boys grew more
      and more fitful, irregular, and feeble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time that any two of them came to take their turn, they felt as
      though this must be the last. And so the hours and the labors of that
      dreary night dragged on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the boys felt that their capacity for work was well nigh exhausted.
      Morning came, and brought the fog. No land appeared. No ship was in sight.
      They sounded a blast on the fog horn, but no reply came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came, and brought, worse than all, the sight of four feet of water
      in the Antelope&rsquo;s hold,&mdash;an amount so great that further pumping was
      useless, and at the best could only delay for a very short time a doom
      that was inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came, then, and brought this sight; and the four feet of water in
      the Antelope&rsquo;s hold at once forced a change in the decision of those on
      board.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw that if they continued pumping they might delay the decisive
      moment somewhat, but that it must come; and if it came with all of them on
      board, they must sink with the sinking schooner. And that the end was
      near, they could see. There was no time for delay. Already the signs which
      met their view told them that the end was near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take to the boat!
    </p>
    <p>
      This was now their thought. To the boat,&mdash;before it was too late! On
      board the boat were all the stores necessary for a protracted voyage; and
      they all began to feel that this boat was now a better place than the
      sinking Antelope. The boat was a place of rest; a place more restricted-,
      yet still, one which promised comparative peace and safety. To that boat,
      therefore, they must go, before it was too late; while yet they could
      embark in peace, and move away from the doomed Antelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was a resort to the boat so hopeless an undertaking as it might appear
      to have been. At the worst, they were in a part of the world where ships
      are frequent; and some of them thought that land was near enough to be
      seen in some direction if only the fog should be dispelled. The stores in
      the boat were sufficient to sustain life for a considerable time, and they
      would be free from the necessity of incessant and most exhaustive labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was now no time for any delay or any hesitation. They all felt this.
      The sight of the Antelope&rsquo;s hold decided them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must take to the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, captain,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t stay any longer. The
      Antelope&rsquo;ll go down before half an hour. If we pump any longer we&rsquo;ll all
      be used up, and won&rsquo;t delay her sinking more than five minutes. Come
      along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin doun!&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, dreamily. &ldquo;Only think of the Antelope
      goin doun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, captain,&rdquo; said Bruce, taking his arm. &ldquo;The boat&rsquo;s all ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;and the Antelope&rsquo;s goin doun! Dear me! Only
      think of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Corbet,&rdquo; said Arthur, solemnly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all ready. Come, go aboard
      the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;well,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Very well. O, all right.
      O, yes. You jest git into the boat. Git along. Never mind me. I&rsquo;ll wait a
      while, you know. You go ahead. I&rsquo;ll jest meander around here while you&rsquo;re
      gettin into the boat. All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the boys went off to the boat, and dropped in one after the other.
      Bruce, and Arthur, and Tom, and Phil, and Bart. Pat lingered behind. Those
      who had got into the boat expected that the others would follow at once,
      and now looked eagerly towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were afloat astern; and there, at the stern of the Antelope, stood
      Captain Corbet, surveying them with a melancholy air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, captain,&rdquo; said Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, all right. Wait till the rest go,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Tain&rsquo;t right for me to
      clar out jest yet. The captain must allers be the last to quit the sinkin
      ship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the boys called to the others,&mdash;to Pat, who had lingered
      behind, to Solomon, and to Wade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pat was standing by the mainmast, To their amazement, they saw that he was
      busily engaged in binding himself to it with ropes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pat,&rdquo; cried Bart, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you hurry up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pat made no reply, but went on as before, solemnly and methodically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pat,&rdquo; cried Tom, &ldquo;what in the world are you waiting for? Hurry up! What
      are you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s tyin meself to the mast, I am,&rdquo; said Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried Bruce, &ldquo;tying yourself to the mast! What nonsense! What do
      you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s the right thing to do,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what they allers does,
      so it is, wheniver a ship gits wracked. Sure I know; and I advise you to
      do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s tying himself to the mast!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad. He&rsquo;s insane. Some
      of us&rsquo;ll have to drag him on board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pat,&rdquo; cried Barty, &ldquo;come along. Are you crazy? The Antelope&rsquo;s sinking!
      What do you mean? Stop that. If you tie yourself to the mast, you&rsquo;ll go
      down with her. What nonsense! Drop that rope, and come with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s safer here,&rdquo; said Pat, calmly, &ldquo;than on that bit of a boat, so
      it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Antelope&rsquo;s sinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, don&rsquo;t I know it? Meself does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll go down in her, if you do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, what are you talking about? In shipwracks, doesn&rsquo;t everybody tie
      themselves to the mast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world shall we do?&rdquo; cried Bart, in despair. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s crazy. I
      never saw anything like it. He&rsquo;s got a craze about tying himself to the
      mast. Don&rsquo;t you remember how he did the very same on board the Petrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go and untie him,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only see how he&rsquo;s fastening and knotting the rope,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to seize him, and bring him here by main force,&rdquo; said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from these thoughts they were now diverted by the appearance of
      Solomon. He had been very busy for about a quarter of an hour, and was now
      pulling away at a rope, as though the salvation of the whole party
      depended upon the successful accomplishment of his design.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon,&rdquo; cried Bart, &ldquo;hurry, hurry! Come along! Hurry! The Antelope&rsquo;s
      going down fast! Hurry, and bring Pat along with you. The captain&rsquo;s
      waiting till you leave the Antelope. Hurry!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;se jest a histin up dis yer cookin-stove,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Ben tyin de ropes
      roun it ebery which way, an jes got her ready to be put into de boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The what!&rdquo; cried Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De cookin-stove,&rdquo; said Solomon, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo; cried Bruce. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone crazy. Pat and Solomon have both gone
      mad with excitement or terror.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You jes gib a left here, an help dis ole man put dis yer cookin-stove
      aboard de boat, an den you &rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon! Solomon!&rdquo; cried Bart, &ldquo;what horrible nonsense! What do you mean
      by talking about putting a cooking-stove on board the boat? Come along. Be
      quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; said Solomon, &ldquo;dis yer stove am a nessary succumstance.
      How you s&rsquo;pose you get you meals cooked? Mus hab a cookin-stove. Mus so.
      You got water to bile, and things to cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense;&rdquo; cried Bart. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see that it&rsquo;ll sink the boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what&rsquo;ll you do?&rdquo; said Solomon. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll suffer if you don&rsquo;t take it.
      You mus hab a cookin-stove. Mus so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this obstinate persistence in such unaccountable folly the boys were in
      despair. The schooner was sinking, lower and lower every minute, and there
      were those on board of her, wasting precious time and chattering nonsense.
      What could be the meaning of this? Had terror deprived them of their
      senses? It seemed so. There was Captain Corbet, absorbed in his own
      thoughts, evidently quite forgetful of the present danger, and unconscious
      of the scene around him. There was Wade, with his heavy face gaping from
      the windlass, where he had seated himself. There was Pat, still tying
      himself to the mast; and there was Solomon, toiling away at the
      cooking-stove. It was like a small floating lunatic asylum. They might
      well feel puzzled and bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly one part of this very difficult problem was solved of its own
      accord. Solomon had not been very careful in the selection of his hoisting
      apparatus. He had picked up some bits of rope, and fastened them around
      the cooking-stove for slings, and into this he had passed the hook from
      the schooner&rsquo;s tackle. He pulled and labored away, hoisting the heavy
      stove, and succeeded in raising it about half way above the hatches. A few
      more pulls, and it would have been on the deck. But there&rsquo;s many a slip &rsquo;twixt
      cup and lip; and so it was destined to prove in this case. For at the very
      moment when the stove hung thus suspended, the slings suddenly gave way,
      and with a rush the heavy mass descended, falling with a loud crash to the
      bottom, and with a force that seemed sufficient to break through the
      Antelope&rsquo;s bottom. There it lay&mdash;a ruin!
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon stood and stared in silence at the scene. At length, drawing a
      long breath, he raised his head and looked at the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dar,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;dat ar&rsquo;s allus de way; troubles neber comes single. Dis
      yer shows dat de end am come. Smash goes de cookin-stove, an shows dat dis
      yer scursium&rsquo;s a goin to tumminate in clamty. Dar ain&rsquo;t a goin to be no
      more eatin in dis yer party; dat&rsquo;s all done up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon! Solomon!&rdquo; cried Bart, &ldquo;hurry up!&rdquo; &ldquo;Solomon! Pat! Wade! Captain
      Corbet! Come! Quick! Hurry up! Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the cries that now burst from those in the boat. They were
      floating close by the schooner, so as to be convenient for those who were
      yet on board. They had seen the destruction of the unfortunate
      cooking-stove, and were now eager to get away before the schooner should
      sink. But their patience was destined to be still further taxed, for
      Solomon continued to make observations on the fallen stove; and Pat went
      on winding the rope about himself and the mast; and Wade sat motionless on
      the windlass; and Captain Corbet stood in the same attitude as before,&mdash;in
      the attitude habitual with him, his hands mechanically grasping the
      tiller, and his mild eyes fixed before him, as though he was still
      steering the Antelope, and watching some shore ahead. But before him there
      was only fog; and what he might have seen was not visible to the material
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use,&rdquo; said Solomon. &ldquo;Dese yer may go, but I&rsquo;se boun to stay. De
      captain may go; an mas&rsquo;r Wade, he may go; an Pat mus frow away dem ropes.
      But for me, I&rsquo;se goin to stick to de ole Antelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s sinking, and sinking fast,&rdquo; cried Bart, with feverish
      impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dar&rsquo;s no odds to dis ole man. Ef I can&rsquo;t stick to de Antelope, I don&rsquo;t
      want to go no whars else. Dar&rsquo;s somebody a waitin for me, an I ain&rsquo;t a
      goin to &rsquo;spose mysef to her, no how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be drowned; you&rsquo;ll be drowned. O, Solomon!&rdquo; cried Bart, &ldquo;cut
      Pat&rsquo;s ropes, and make him come; and hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, captain. Make haste. Cut Pat&rsquo;s ropes, Solomon. Come, Wade.
      The schooner&rsquo;ll go down in five minutes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; said Solomon; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t care a mite. I&rsquo;se dreadful fraid ob dat
      ar ole woman. I&rsquo;d rader be drowned here dis yar way, dan be hammered to
      def wid a red-hot poker. Dat&rsquo;s so; mind I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys were now in an agony of impatience and anxiety. The waters were
      high in the hold of the Antelope. They could see, from where they stood in
      the boat, the dark gleam of the rising flood, and knew that any moment
      might now witness the last plunge of the schooner into the depths below.
      And so they shouted, and screamed, and called upon every one in succession
      of those who still so madly lingered behind. But their cries were
      unheeded; for those four on the deck of the Antelope made not the
      slightest movement in response.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boys had left the Antelope, the water in her hold was about four
      feet in depth. All the time since then it had been increasing; yet, after
      all, though the time seemed long to the anxious boys, not over a quarter
      of an hour had elapsed in reality.

      waters continued to rise in the hold of the Antelope, and inch by inch the
      doomed schooner settled slowly down into the depths beneath. On the deck
      stood those four who still held aloof from the boat, and seemed to be
      animated by some insane or unintelligible motive. By the side of the
      schooner floated the boat, in which were Bruce, Arthur, Tom, Phil, and
      Bart. They were all standing up, and holding the Antelope&rsquo;s rail, and
      shouting, bawling, yelling, entreating, threatening, and using every
      possible means to save their unfortunate companions. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Bart drew his knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to drag them off. Bruce and Arthur, come
      along. Tom and Phil, you mind the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he jumped on board the Antelope, with his open knife in
      his hand. Bruce and Arthur leaped on board after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of Bart, with his open knife, thus bounding on board the
      Antelope, astonished the other boys, who began to think that Bart, like
      the others, had also lost his senses; but they did as he said&mdash;Tom
      and Phil holding the boat to the side of the Antelope, and watching, while
      Bruce and Arthur followed Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart first rushed to Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to stand this. You&rsquo;re ruining us all. If you don&rsquo;t go
      aboard the boat, we&rsquo;ll throw you overboard, and you&rsquo;ll be glad to do it
      then. Bruce and Arthur, catch hold, and pitch Pat overboard if he don&rsquo;t go
      to the boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Speaking these words with breathless rapidity, Bart cut the rope with
      which Pat had bound himself, giving long slashes up and down. Bruce and
      Arthur seized him at the same moment, and as soon as the rope was severed,
      dragged him to where the boat was, ordering him on board, and threatening
      to throw him into the water if he refused. Pat was powerless. A few words
      of remonstrance were offered, but he was sternly silenced. He was thus
      overpowered, and so, yielding to necessity, he got on board the boat.
      There he seated himself in the stern, and, bowing his head, began a long,
      low, wailing Irish &ldquo;keen,&rdquo; which is a species of lamentation in the
      presence of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      This scene appeared to produce some effect upon Wade. It roused him from
      his lethargy. It seemed as though this man was a mere machine; and though
      in ordinary circumstances he was able of going through certain routine
      duties, in any extraordinary case he was utterly helpless, and his dull
      and inert nature became hopelessly imbecile. But now an idea of his
      situation seemed at last to have penetrated to his brain, and accordingly,
      rising to his feet, he went to the boat. Then he slowly and solemnly
      passed over the Antelope&rsquo;s side, and took his seat near Pat. He looked at
      the others with a dull stare, and then turning to Pat, he remarked, in a
      low, confidential tone, &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Wade, an my ole &lsquo;oman&rsquo;s name&rsquo;s Gipson;
      an you&rsquo;ll not find many o&rsquo; that name in this country. No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After which he heaved a sigh, and relapsed into himself. As to Pat, he
      took no notice of this confidence imparted to him, but went on with his
      Irish lamentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow&mdash;O-o-o-o-ow&mdash;to only think&mdash;this bit ov a boat sure&mdash;an
      in the wide an impty say&mdash;an me a bindin meself to the only safety;
      for the ship-wracked sayman must always bind himsilf to a mast. And,
      O-o-o-b-o-o-o-w, but it was a bitter, crool thing, so it was, to tear a
      poor boy from his solitary rifuge&mdash;an dhrive him here into a bit ov a
      boat&mdash;to sail over the impty say&mdash;an from the last rifuge&mdash;where
      safety was, an O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ow! but it&rsquo;s the croolty ov it that braks
      me heart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The summary treatment with which the boys had disposed of Pat, was not to
      be applied to Solomon, or to Captain Corbet. They tried to coax these, and
      persuade them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon, however, was obdurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My &rsquo;vice to you, boys, an you, in tiklar, mas&rsquo;r Bart,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;is to clar out ob dis yer sinkin schooner, ef yer don want to git a
      duckin ob de wustest sort. She&rsquo;s a goin down&mdash;you&rsquo;d betta believe&mdash;dat&rsquo;s
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, come, come, Solomon; we can&rsquo;t wait. You&rsquo;re making us all risk our
      lives,&rdquo; said Bart, imploringly, coaxing him as he would coax an insane
      man. &ldquo;Come along; don&rsquo;t keep us here. The schooner&rsquo;ll sink and drag the
      boat down, if we don&rsquo;t keep farther away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darsn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Solomon. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t, darsn&rsquo;t&mdash;no how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darsn&rsquo;t&mdash;fraid ob dat ar ole woman, wid de broomstick, de tongs, de
      fence-pole, an de red-hot gridiron. Tell you what, it stings&mdash;it
      does, dreadful&mdash;it does so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, come. She shall never trouble you. Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to go skewrity for dat ar statement? Nobody can skewer her. No.
      Better be drown-ded, dan walloped to def with hay-forks. Nobody can skewer
      dat ar ole woman, dough; gracious sakes, she knows how to skewer me ebery
      time she lay hand on a pitchfork or a meat-skewer. Yah, yah, yah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this ill-timed levity Bart and the others turned away in despair and
      disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hurried aft.
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood the venerable Corbet. As they drew near he gave a start, and a
      smile came over his reverend countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, boys,&rdquo; said he, in a tone of kindly welcome, &ldquo;how d&rsquo;ye do? Pleased
      to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke precisely as if he was receiving a call from some favorite
      guests. The tone pained the boys, and distressed them greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Bruce, hurriedly, &ldquo;the Antelope&rsquo;s sinking. A moment more
      and you&rsquo;ll be lost. Come with us in the boat. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, laying his hand on the captain&rsquo;s arm, he sought to drag him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the captain quietly though firmly, disengaged himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, young sir,&rdquo; said the venerable navigator, very politely; &ldquo;but
      I&rsquo;m captain of this here craft; an, being sich, I ain&rsquo;t got no call to
      leave her till the last man. You git to your boat, an I&rsquo;ll retire when the
      time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain spoke with dignity. He announced a principle which involves
      the highest duty of every commander of a ship, and the boys knew it. His
      dignity overawed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But come now, captain,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t a moment to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t, a goin ever to hev it written on my tume,&rdquo; said the captain, in
      a calm voice, &ldquo;that me&mdash;Captain Corbet&mdash;ever desarted his post,
      or forgot his umble dooty as commander of a vessel. No, the Antelope&rsquo;ll
      see that, her captain&rsquo;s jist as much principle an honor as any of them
      swell navigators that sail in clipper ships over the boosom of the briny
      deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment there was a long-drawn, bubbling, gurgling sound, that came
      up from the hold of the Antelope, and startled the boys exceedingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, captain,&rdquo; cried Bruce. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sinking now. There isn&rsquo;t a
      moment to spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, boys, you jist hurry off into that thar boat, an don&rsquo;t mind me. I
      know my dooty. You can&rsquo;t expect me to leave this here deck till the last
      man. It don&rsquo;t signify argufyin. Hurry off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment there was another sound; something between a gasp and a
      gurgle. It seemed like the death-rattle of the Antelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going down, boys!&rdquo; cried Bart. Involuntarily they retreated towards
      the boat. But here they paused yet again, for there was a brief respite,
      and the Antelope was yet afloat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come, captain?&rdquo; cried Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, all right,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, waving his hand; &ldquo;all right. You jest
      get aboard the boat. Don&rsquo;t you mind me. Remember, I&rsquo;m the captain, an I&rsquo;ve
      got to be the last man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed to the boys like a promise to follow them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, boys,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get into the boat if we do. He wants
      to be last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, the three boys clambered over the Antelope&rsquo;s side, and it was
      with a feeling of relief that they found themselves once more in the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, captain,&rdquo; cried Bruce, &ldquo;hurry up. Come, Solomon. Captain, make
      Solomon come on board, and then you&rsquo;ll be the last man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet smiled, and made no reply. As for Solomon, he merely
      muttered something about &ldquo;dat ar ole woman&rdquo; and &ldquo;gridiron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Antelope was low in the water. The deck was near the level of the sea.
      Instinctively, Tom, who was holding the rail, pushed away, and the boat
      moved off a little distance. Yet they could not leave those two infatuated
      men to their fate, though the instinct of self-preservation made them thus
      move away slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain! Solomon! Captain! Solomon! Make haste! O, make haste!&rdquo; Such were
      the cries that now came from those in the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet smiled as before, and nodded, and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s all right; all right. Don&rsquo;t mind me. I&rsquo;m all right. I know what
      I&rsquo;m about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this the Antelope gave a very unpleasant roll, and settled heavily on
      one side; then her bows sank down, and a big wave rolled over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sinking!&rdquo; cried Tom, in a voice of horror. The other boys were
      silent. They seemed petrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Antelope struggled up, and gradually righted herself. Her deck was
      nearer the level of the sea than ever. This last incident, however, had
      been sufficient to shake the nerves of one of those two on board. As she
      settled on one side, Solomon sprang back, and, as the wave rolled over her
      bows, he gave one jump over the side and into the sea. He sank under, but
      a moment afterwards his woolly head emerged, and he struck out for the
      boat. There a dozen arms were outstretched to save him, and he was finally
      hauled in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drefful times dese,&rdquo; said he, as his teeth chattered, either from terror
      or from cold. &ldquo;Drefful times. Didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;gage in dis yer vessel to go
      swim-min about de Atlantic Oceum. Queer way to serve as cook&mdash;dis yer
      way. An dar ain&rsquo;t a dry stitch ob clothin about&mdash;dat&rsquo;s so; an what
      ebber I&rsquo;se a goin to do beats me. S&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;se got to set here an shibber
      de next tree weeks. Catch me ebber a &rsquo;barkin aboard sieh a schooner
      as dis yer. Any ways, I ain&rsquo;t goin to sail in dis yer Antelope agin. Cotch
      me at it&mdash;dat&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the boys heard nothing of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      All their attention was now taken up with Captain Corbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood at the stern at his usual post, holding the tiller with both
      hands. He looked at the boys. &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the last aboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, Captain Corbet! Come, come. Make haste!&rdquo; they cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his venerable head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;boys, air the act an the doin of Fate. I did hope
      that the Antelope an me&rsquo;d grow old, an finally die together, though not on
      the briny deep. It hev allus ben a favorite idee to me, that the lives of
      both of us, me and the Antelope, was kine o&rsquo; intermingled, an that as we&rsquo;d
      ben lovely an pleasant in our lives, in death we&rsquo;d be not divided. For the
      Antelope an me&rsquo;s knowed each other long, an lived, an ben happy together,
      in fair weather an foul. The Antelope&rsquo;s allus ben faithful and terew.
      She&rsquo;s had all my confidences. She&rsquo;s alius been gentle an kind, and you&rsquo;ll
      never, never find a better friend than the old Antelope. Many&rsquo;s the time
      she&rsquo;s bore me through sleet an snow. Many&rsquo;s the time she&rsquo;s borne me
      through fog an rain. Many&rsquo;s the time she&rsquo;s bore me past rocks an reefs. So
      long as I stuck to old Fundy, so long the Antelope was safe an sound. I
      used to boast as to how I could navigate old Fundy. I was wrong. &rsquo;Twan&rsquo;t
      me; it was the Antelope that navigated; for I never had a sexton aboard,
      nor a quadruped, nor a spy-glass, nor any of them newfangled gimcracks,
      savin an except a real old-fashioned, apostolic compass, as is mentioned
      by Paul in the Acts. And why? Why, cos the Antelope was allus able to feel
      her own way through rain an fog, an frost an snow&mdash;past shoals, an
      flats, an reefs, an was alius faithful. But, in a evil hour, I took her
      out of her native waters. I led her afar over the deep blue sea, up to the
      Gulf of St. Lawrence. There our woes began. But even there the Antelope
      was terew an tender. But it was too much. We come back. She had never ben
      thar before. She lost her way. Then she found it. We got to Sable Island
      an Chester. Then we put out agin. An then agin she lost her way. It was my
      fault, not hern. She lost her way in this fog, an she went aground. She
      couldn&rsquo;t help it. In Fundy she never ran aground, &rsquo;cept when
      nessary; an it was me that brought her to this. An now what hev I got to
      do? I&rsquo;ve got this to do&mdash;that if I&rsquo;ve led my Antelope to ruin, I
      won&rsquo;t survive her. No. We&rsquo;ve been lovely an pleasant in our lives, an in
      death we ain&rsquo;t goin to be divided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys did not hear one half of this, but interrupted the speaker
      constantly with their entreaties that he would save himself. Captain
      Corbet, however, was too much taken up with his own thoughts to notice
      what they said. He was like one who soliloquizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, captain!&rdquo; cried Bart, with a final effort; &ldquo;think of your wife&mdash;think
      of your, your, a&mdash;baby&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My babby!&rdquo; said Captain Corbet. &ldquo;My babby! Ah, young sir, when you
      mention my babby, you don&rsquo;t know that you tetch a cord in this parentual
      heart that throbs responsive. That thar is the strongest emotion that
      inspires this aged breast; but, young sir, dooty air powerfuller than
      love, an even that pe-recious infant has less claims on me at this moment
      than my Antelope. For my Antelope has ben the friend that&rsquo;s ben faithful
      in thousand perls; that&rsquo;s ben my refuge an my solace in times of
      persecution. Yes, young sirs, in the days when a bold an violent woman
      disturbed my peace, by dash-in a pail full of cold water over my head&mdash;at
      such times the Antelope hav took me to her heart; an can I ever cease to
      be affectionate an kind to thee, who&rsquo;s ben so terewly kind to me&mdash;my
      Antelope? No, no; young sirs. Go, an tell my beloved one&mdash;my
      offspring&mdash;my inspired babby&mdash;that his parent, the aged Corbet,
      died a marchure&rsquo;s death; died like a hero, a standin&rsquo; at his post; which
      post was the rudder-post of the Antelope. Tell him that; an tell him, tew,
      that, though dooty bound the feyther to the Antelope, yet still that
      feyther&rsquo;s last thoughts was of his belessed babe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point the Antelope gave another lurch, and rolled far over.
      Captain Corbet stopped abruptly, and stiffened his sinews, and clutched
      the tiller with a tighter grasp. The boys looked on with horror in their
      faces and in their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment of awful expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had cried, and bawled, and yelled till they were hoarse. They had
      prayed and entreated Captain Corbet to save himself. All in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the time for entreaty had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the Antelope rolled back, and then her bows sank. A huge wave
      rolled over her, followed by others, which foamed from bow to stern. Then
      all the sea settled itself over the sinking schooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Antelope was going down!
    </p>
    <p>
      The hull disappeared!
    </p>
    <p>
      The rail sank under water!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Captain Corbet stood at his post, erect, rigid, his hands clasping the
      tiller. Beneath him the Antelope sank down into the sea. Around him the
      waters rolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rolled about his knees; about his thighs; about his waist. His
      venerable hair fluttered in the breeze; his eyes were fixed, with a rapt
      and abstracted air, on vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys looked on in horror. Instinctively they pushed the boat back out
      of the reach of the waters that ingulfed the Antelope, so as to avoid
      being carried down into that vortex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waters rolled about the form of the aged navigator, and so he
      descended with his beloved Antelope, till they were above his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys could no longer cry to him. They were petrified with horror. They
      sat, with white faces, awaiting the end.

      thing it was to see the Antelope thus sinking into the sea; to view the
      waters thus rolling over her familiar form from bows to stern; to see the
      boiling foam of the ingulfing billows; but how much more terrible it was
      to see the sacrifice of a human life; the voluntary self-destruction of a
      human being, and of one, too, who had been their guide, their revered and
      beloved friend! They had no cause for self-reproach. They had done all
      that they could. His own will had brought him to this. Still the spectacle
      was no less terrible to all of them, and there was no less anguish in
      their souls as they saw him,&mdash;the meek, the gentle, the venerable
      Corbet,&mdash;thus descending, by his own free will, and by his own act,
      into the dark abyss of this unknown sea. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they watched with pallid faces, and with angonized hearts for the
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient mariner sank down, as has been said, with his sinking
      schooner, and his feet were overwhelmed by the rushing flood, and his
      ankles, and his knees, and his thighs, and at length he stood there with
      the waters about his waist, and his mild eyes fixed upon vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another moment, and they expected to see that venerable and beloved form
      disappear forever from their gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that venerable form did not, in fact, disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0293.jpg" alt="0293 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0293.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      That venerable form remained stationary,&mdash;the waters reaching as far
      as the waist: thus far, but no farther. The lower half had disappeared
      beneath the sea, but the upper half still remained to bless and cheer
      their eyes. Corbet still lived! But it was what an artist might call a
      Torso of Corbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corbet thus had sunk into the unfathomable depth of ocean up to his waist,
      but after that he sank no more. Higher than that the waters did not rise.
      He stood in that rigid attitude already described, grasping the tiller,
      and thus steadying himself,&mdash;upright, firm as a rock, and so he stood
      after the waters had risen to his waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hull of the Antelope had disappeared. But still her masts and rigging
      rose above the waters, and above the head of Corbet, and these sank no
      farther, but remained at the same height above the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astonishment seized upon all of them, Corbet included. What was it that
      had caused this wonder? Was it because the hull was too buoyant to sink
      any farther? Was it because there was still some air left inside the hull
      which prevented the schooner from sinking altogether? This they might have
      thought had they not been made wiser through their recent experiences. By
      these they now knew that on these seas there were sand banks and shoals;
      and, therefore, what was more natural than that, the Antelope had sunk in
      some place where there happened to be, just beneath her, a convenient
      shoal which had received her sinking hull? It was certainly a very curious
      sea,&mdash;a sea which seemed to abound in such shoals as these; but
      whatever might be the character of that sea, this fact remained, that the
      Antelope had sunk in less than a couple of fathoms of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was that the heroic and devoted resolve of the venerable and
      high-minded captain was baffled, and his descent into the depths of the
      ocean was arrested. For there lay the Antelope, resting upon some place
      not far beneath the sea, with her masts still high above water, and with
      the person of her gifted commander half submerged and half exposed to
      view; and there stood that venerable commander up to his waist in water,
      but unable to descend any farther: a singular, a wonderful, an
      unparalleled spectacle; unaccountable altogether to those whose eyes were
      fastened upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the thought of a shoal or sand bank soon came, and so they began to
      understand the state of affairs. The Antelope had sunk, not into an
      unfathomable abyss in mid-ocean, but upon some sand bank. Where or what
      that sand-bank might be, they did not then take time to consider. Whether
      it was some part of one of the Banks of Newfoundland, or the slowly
      declining shore around Sable Island, or some other far different and far
      removed place, did not at that time enter into the sphere of their
      calculations. Enough it was for them that the terror had passed; that the
      grim spectacle of death and destruction before their very eyes had been
      averted; that Corbet was saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till this moment they had not been aware of the greatness of their
      anguish. But now the reaction from that anguish made them acquainted with
      its intensity, and in proportion to their late sufferings was now their
      joy and rejoicing. At the first movement of the Antelope towards a descent
      into the sea, they had instinctively and very naturally moved their boat
      farther away, so as to avoid being sharers of the fate which Captain
      Corbet seemed to desire; but now, after the first danger was over, and the
      first emotions of amazement and wonder had subsided, they rowed nearer.
      They believed that now Captain Corbet would listen to reason, and that,
      having done so much in obedience to the call of duty, he would be willing
      to save himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as they rowed nearer, the boat floated over the rail of the
      sunken schooner, and came close up to the half-submerged commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, captain,&rdquo; said Bart, in a voice that was yet tremulous with
      excitement, &ldquo;jump in. There&rsquo;s plenty of room. You&mdash;you&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      want to be standing in the water this way any longer, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this remark Captain Corbet made no reply in words, but he did make a
      reply in acts, which were far more eloquent. He seized the side of the
      boat at once, and scrambling in, sank down, wet and shivering, in the
      stern, alongside of those other obstinate and contumacious ones&mdash;Pat,
      Wade, and Solomon. And so it was that at last, after so much trouble,
      those four, who had at first been so unmanageable, now were assembled on
      board the boat into which they had once refused to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delight of the boys was as great as their grief had been a short time
      before, and no other thought came into their minds than that of the happy
      end that had occurred to a scene that had promised such disaster. The fact
      that their situation was one of doubt and uncertainty, perhaps peril, did
      not just then occur to them. It was enough joy for them that Captain
      Corbet had been snatched from a watery grave; and so they now surrounded
      him with careful attention. Bruce offered him a biscuit; Bart asked about
      his health; Tom urged him to wring out the water from his trousers; and
      Phil, who was next to him in the boat, fearing that he might feel faint,
      pressed upon him a tin dipper full of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet took the proffered draught and raised it to his lips. A few
      swallows, however, satisfied him, and he put it down with some appearance
      of haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a general thing,&rdquo; said he, in a tone of mild remonstrance, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      use sea water for a beverage. I kin take it, but don&rsquo;t hanker arter it, as
      the man said when he ate the raw crow on a bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sea water!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised the water to his own lips, and found that it was so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve taken sea water in this keg,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and we haven&rsquo;t any
      fresh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this dreadful intelligence consternation filled all minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who filled that keg?&rdquo; asked Bruce, after a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I did,&rdquo; said Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! and how did you happen to make such a mistake?&rdquo; cried Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure ye said to fill the kegs with wather, an didn&rsquo;t say what kind; so I
      jist tuk the say wather, because it was most convaynient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this amazing blunder the boys were dumb, and stared at Pat in silence.
      Words were useless. The mistake was a fatal one. The fresh water had gone
      with the Antelope to the bottom. Where or when could they hope to get any
      more? Who could tell how long a time, or how great a distance, might now
      separate them from the land? Bad enough their situation already had been,
      but this opened up before them the prospect of unknown sufferings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t talk to me about water,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, in lugubrious
      tones, squeezing his hands, as he spoke, over his thighs and shins, so as
      to force the water out of his clothes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go and talk to me about
      water. I&rsquo;ve hed enough, an don&rsquo;t want ever to see any agin. Why, it kem up
      as high as my waist if it kem a inch. An now what&rsquo;s to hender me a fallin
      a helpuless victim to rheuma-tiz. O, I know it. Don&rsquo;t tell me. I know
      what&rsquo;s a goin to come to this ferrail body. Thar&rsquo;s rheuma-tiz acute and
      chronic, an thar&rsquo;s pleurisy, an thar&rsquo;s lumbago, an thar&rsquo;s nooralgy, an
      thar&rsquo;s fifty other diseases equally agonizin. An dear, dear, dear, dear!
      But how dreadful wet it did feel, to be sure! dear, dear, dear, dear! An
      here am I now, with my tendency to rheumatiz, a settin here in my wet
      clothes, an not a dry stitch to be had for love or money. Wal, I never
      knowed anythin like this here, an I&rsquo;ve lived a life full of sturrange
      vycissitudes&mdash;from bad to wuss has ben our fate ever sence we sot
      foot on this here eventfual vyge; an ef thar&rsquo;s any lesson to be larned
      from sech doins an car&rsquo;ns on as this here, why, I ain&rsquo;t able to see it. An
      now what am I to do? What&rsquo;s a goin to become of me? No dry clothes! No
      fire to dry myself! Rheumatiz before me! lumbago behind me! pleurisy on
      each side o&rsquo; me! such is the te-rific prospect of the blighted bein that
      now addresses you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys paid but little attention to Captain Corbet&rsquo;s wailings. They had
      other troubles more serious than these prospective ones. They could not
      help, however, being struck by the thought that it was a little odd for a
      man who had just been snatched so narrowly from a terrible death to
      confine all his attention and all his lamentations to such a very ordinary
      circumstance as wet clothes. He who had announced so firmly, a short time
      before, his calm and fixed intention of perishing with the Antelope, now
      seemed to have forgotten all about her, and thought only of himself and
      his rheumatiz. Could this be, indeed, Captain Corbet? Strange was the
      change that had come over him; yet this was not the only singular change
      that had occurred on this eventful day. They had witnessed others quite as
      wonderful in Solomon and Pat. These two, however, had now resumed their
      usual characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they were, in a boat, all of them, but where? That was the question.
      The masts of the sunken Antelope rose obliquely out of the water, showing
      that she was resting on her side at the bottom. But what was that bottom,
      and where? Was it some lonely rock or reef? Was it some sand-bank or shoal
      like that upon which they had already gone aground, and where the Antelope
      had received those injuries which had at length wrought her ruin? None of
      them could answer this.
    </p>
    <p>
      And where should they go? In what direction should they turn? This was the
      question that pressed upon them, and required immediate decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to even guess where we are,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been going
      in the dark all along. We may as well be off Sable Island as anywhere
      else. And if so, all I can say is, I&rsquo;ve seen worse places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an thin it&rsquo;s as likely to be Anticosti as Sable Island,&rdquo; said Pat.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve ben a turrunin around ivery way, so we have, an we may have&lt;
      fetched up there, so we may, an if that&rsquo;s so, we may as well dig our
      graves an lay ourselves down in thim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re going so far as that,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d put in a claim
      for Bermuda. I don&rsquo;t see why we mayn&rsquo;t be off Bermuda as well as
      Anticosti. If so, we may be sure of good accommodations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, while you&rsquo;re about it,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you say Jamaica?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it should turn, out to
      be Newfoundland. This sou&rsquo;-west wind would take us there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but there&rsquo;s been a calm,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;for some time, and we&rsquo;ve got
      into some current. I dare say it&rsquo;s taken us west, and that this is close
      by Cape Cod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;If we&rsquo;ve been drifting with any current, there&rsquo;s only
      one current hereabouts. That&rsquo;s the Gulf Stream. I tell you what it is,
      boys; we&rsquo;ve crossed the Atlantic, and this place is off the coast of Owld
      Ireland; and there ye have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah, go way wid yer deludherin talk,&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;We want a sinsible
      opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more I think of it,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;the more I&rsquo;m inclined to be of Bart&rsquo;s
      opinion. We&rsquo;ve been tacking and drifting, and going backward and forward,
      and it seems to me most likely that this is Sable Island. If so, we may be
      glad that we came here when the water was so calm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, thoughtfully, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve that this here
      air Ireland, nor Iceland, nor Africky, nor Jamaiky, nor any other sech. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t
      unpossible for it to be Sable Island. We drifted there onst, an may heve
      done it agin. Far be it from me to dispute that thar. But then again it
      might be Newfoundland. &rsquo;Pears to me as ef we&rsquo;ve got off some land
      whar thar&rsquo;s woods, for I got jest now a kine a scent o&rsquo; trees, an &rsquo;peared
      to me of spruce an sech. I shouldn&rsquo;t be s&rsquo;prised ef the wind was to haul
      round. It often doos, specially when it&rsquo;s ben an done its wust, an you
      don&rsquo;t care. So now we don&rsquo;t care what it doos, or which way it blows; an
      consekently it&rsquo;s goin to turn an blow away the fog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, and while the ancient mariner was yet speaking, there came
      a breath of wind, very gentle, yet quite perceptible, and there was in it
      an unmistakable odor of forest trees&mdash;balmy, delicious, most
      fragrant, bringing with it hope, and joy, and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The land must be close by,&rdquo; cried Bart. &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurrah too soon,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;It may be Anticosti.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! Anticosti could never send out such a smell of spruce and pine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it may be Newfoundland, and that won&rsquo;t help us much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind&rsquo;s going to change,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;I think the fog isn&rsquo;t so thick
      as it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, boys, this bottom shoals in some direction. Let&rsquo;s sound, and row on
      in the direction where it shoals. That&rsquo;ll bring us to the shore.&rdquo; This
      suggestion, which came from Bruce, was at once acted on. Bart and Tom took
      the oars. Bruce took a hatchet which had been flung into the boat, and
      tying a line to it, used this as a sounding lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Row gently,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys did so, following Bruce&rsquo;s direction, while, holding his
      sounding-line, he tested the bottom. After a little while he had satisfied
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shoals in this direction,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Row straight on a dozen strokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruce sounded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Row on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rowed farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruce sounded again. The bottom was much shallower.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rowed farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now no sounding was any longer necessary, for there, straight before
      them, looming through the now lessening fog, they all descried the welcome
      sight of land.

      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE sight of land a cry
      of joy burst forth from all in the boat, and Bart and Torn bent to their
      oars with all their force. As they drew nearer, they saw, to their intense
      delight, that this strange land was no wilderness, no desolate shore, but
      an inhabited place, with cultivated fields, and pasture land, and groves.
      One by one, new features in the landscape revealed themselves. There was a
      long beach, with a grand sweep that curved itself away on either side,
      till it joined steep or precipitous shores. Behind this were fields, all
      green with verdure, and a scattered settlement, whose white houses, of
      simple, yet neat construction, looked most invitingly to these shipwrecked
      wanderers. At one end of the winding beach rose the fabric of a large ship
      in process of construction. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearer they came, and yet nearer. The tide was high on the beach, and the
      waters almost touched the green fields that fringed the shore with alder
      bushes. Here a boat was drawn up, and beyond this stood a neat farm-house.
      On a fence nets were hanging, showing that the occupant of this house
      united the two callings of farmer and fisher. Beyond the settlement, the
      land rose into high hills, which were covered with forest trees, and from
      these had been wafted that aromatic breeze which had first made known to
      them the neighborhood of land.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the breeze had been slightly increasing, and the fog had
      been steadily diminishing. Now the shores appeared in fuller outline.
      Looking back over their course, they could see the masts of the Antelope,
      where they projected above the water. They could see that they had drifted
      into a bay, and the Antelope had sunk into its shallowest part.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in this scene which appeared to them strangely and
      most unaccountably familiar. All had the same feeling, yet not one of them
      expressed it. Each imagined that it was his own fancy; and so disturbed
      had their minds been for the past few days, that they felt unwilling now
      to indulge this fancy. Yet every moment the fancy grew stronger, and
      brought fresh wonder with it. In this way they rowed along, and every
      moment brought the boat nearer and nearer to the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they saw a man come forth from the house before them, and
      advance towards the beach. His face was turned towards them; he was
      staring at them most intently. As the boat advanced, he advanced; and thus
      the two parties approached. Every moment revealed more and more of the
      opposite party to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart and Tom were rowing, and thus had their backs turned to the shore and
      their faces towards the sea outside. Here the fog was fast dispelling, and
      as it fled, there opened up mile after mile of the coast, and the sea
      horizon. There, on that horizon, there came forth out of the fog to their
      eyes a solitary object, that appeared to float upon the sea. It revealed
      itself more and more; and first, magnified and distorted by the mist, it
      seemed like a lofty table land of cloud, then like a giant rock, but at
      length resolved itself into a wooded island with precipitous sides. There
      it lay full before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it thus revealed itself, Tom uttered a wild shout. Bart instantly
      uttered another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys! Boys! Look! Look! Hurrah! Hur-ra-a-a-a-a-a-ah!
      Hurra-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at that very instant there arose a wild outcry&mdash;a clamor worse
      than theirs&mdash;from all the others in the boat. Solomon gave a yell,
      Captain Corbet started up, and ceased to stroke his legs Bruce, Arthur,
      Phil, and Pat, with one wild cry, started erect to their feet, regardless
      of the swaying and rocking of the boat. And &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; they cried.
      &ldquo;Hurra-a-a-a-a-a-a-ah!! Hurra-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s Bay! Ile Haute!&rdquo; cried Tom and Bart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s Bay! Benny Grigg!&rdquo; cried all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s&mdash;Grigg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benny-Haute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ile-Bay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Benny-Bay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ile-Grigg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scott&rsquo;s Haute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the medley of cries that arose from all, shouting and yelling at
      once. While all the time there stood on the shore the man that had come
      down to meet them; who first had started and stared with amazement,&mdash;and
      who then, recognizing them all, and seeing the masts of the sunken
      schooner beyond, understood the whole situation, and rejoiced over it
      accordingly&mdash;showing his joy, indeed, in a less noisy and
      demonstrative manner than theirs, but in a way which was thoroughly
      characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Benny suddenly turned, and started off to the house on a full run.
      Then he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat drew nearer, Benny appeared once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat touched the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that very instant Benny touched the beach also, and, plunging into the
      water, began shaking hands with every one of them, in the most violent and
      vehement manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along! Come along! Come right up! Come along! Don&rsquo;t mind the boat.
      I&rsquo;ll see to that. Come along to the house. Blowed if I ever see the likes
      o&rsquo; this in all my born days! Come along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such was the welcome of Benny Grigg.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in this way Benny dragged them all up to his house. Here he gave them
      another welcome, characterized by a lavish hospitality, and a warmhearted
      friendliness that was truly delightful to his guests; in all of which he
      was seconded by Mrs. Benny. The table that was spread before them was
      loaded down with everything that the house could furnish, and the
      shipwrecked guests ate with an appetite such as is only known to those who
      have labored hard and fasted long.
    </p>
    <p>
      After which Benny questioned them all closely, and made them tell him how
      it was that they had come here. Great was his astonishment, but greater
      still his amusement. Though it had so nearly been a tragedy, to hear it
      seemed like a comedy. There is but one step between the sublime and the
      ridiculous&mdash;the terrible and the grotesque&mdash;tragedy and comedy.
      Benny chose to regard it all from the lighter point of view, and
      accordingly he laughed with unrestrained hilarity, and made merry with
      exceeding mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after the story was all told, he grew more serious, and, producing a
      well-worn chart, he explained to them his theory as to their wanderings.
      He pointed out to them the probable place where the Antelope had struck,
      described the character of the tides and currents, and showed how it was
      that, with such a wind, and under such circumstances, they, very
      naturally, had drifted into this particular part of the Bay of Fundy.
      Benny&rsquo;s explanation was indeed so very lucid, and so satisfactory, that
      they all expressed their regrets at not having known this before, in which
      case they would have been saved from much anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they arrived at Scott&rsquo;s Bay it was high tide, but by the time that
      they had finished their story and the conversation that had been caused by
      it, the tide was far down on the ebb. On going forth they could see that
      the deck of the Antelope had been uncovered by the retreating waters. In
      two or three hours more the tide would be at the lowest ebb, and they
      could see that it would be possible for them to visit the sunken schooner.
      It lay about a mile away from the beach, between which and her there
      extended long mud flats, which could easily be traversed at low water.
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited till the tide was low, and then they all walked down to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she lay&mdash;the Antelope&mdash;the vessel that had carried them so
      far, through strange seas, amid so many dangers and perils&mdash;the
      vessel associated with so many memories. They climbed on board. They saw
      that her hold was still full of water; for, though the crevices were
      numerous, and wide enough to let in the sea, they could not let it out
      with sufficient rapidity to keep pace with the fall of the tide. Still,
      the water streamed out in small jets, or trickled out, drop by drop, in a
      hundred places, affording them a very impressive sight of the true
      condition of the Antelope, and of the danger against which they had
      struggled so long and so laboriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the water&rsquo;d ony get out of her,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet, in a melancholy
      voice, &ldquo;she might float ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Benny, &ldquo;she might float, perhaps, as far as the shore, but no
      farther. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no manner of uthly use a tryin to repair that thar
      craft, cos she&rsquo;s ben an gone an got done for. She&rsquo;s wore out, the wustest
      kind. That thar vessel ain&rsquo;t wuth a tryin to repair her. It&rsquo;s a mussy she
      held out so long, an didn&rsquo;t go to pieces all of a suddent, some-whars in
      the middle of the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this Captain Corbet made no reply. He felt keenly the truth of the
      remark, and could see that the Antelope was indeed beyond the reach of
      human aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys all climbed on board of the beloved, though battered old craft,
      to take a last look and a last farewell. It was with unconcealed sadness
      that they looked around. They could not go down into the cabin, or the
      hold, for the water was there; yet the deck was enough to remind them of
      that eventful past which they had experienced here. This was the schooner
      that had borne them on their cruise around Minas Bay; which had taken them
      around the Bay of Fundy when Tom was lost; which had afterwards taken them
      to the Bay de Chaleur. This was the schooner for whose appearance they had
      so watched and waited on board the water-logged Petrel, and which had
      lately borne them over so many miles of watery sea, through so many
      leagues of fog. And this was the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Corbet it was that first broke the solemn silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It air gone,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the derream hev bust! The berright derream of
      fortin, of wealth, an of perosperity. Gone, tew, air the ole Antelope&mdash;companion
      of my toils, my feelins, an my fame. Boys, you hev ben the confidants of
      my feelins towards this here Antelope, an knows how I loved her, yea, even
      as the apple of my aged eye! I stood here, not long sence, by yon rudder,
      fixed firm an solemn; resolved to perish with her; ready to sink into the
      deep blue sea. From that fate I was spared; yet still my feelins air the
      same; the heart&rsquo;s the same&mdash;&lsquo;twill ne&rsquo;er grow cold. An now I feel to
      mourn. I feel that I am indeed a growin old. The days of my navigatin air
      brought to an end. Henceforth the briny deep will be traversed by the aged
      Corbet no more forever. From this time I retire from the heavin biller, an
      take refooge in my own vine an fig tree. My navigatin arter this&rsquo;ll be,
      with my belessed babby in my arms, up an down the room. The only storms
      that await me now, an the only squalls, air to be of a sterictly domestic
      characture. Weak human natur, boys, might be tempted to repine, an to
      indulge in vain lamintations over this here; but the time hev passed. I&rsquo;ve
      made my lamintation, an that&rsquo;s enough. I&rsquo;ll lament no more. Peace to her
      ashes. Let her lie, an may no rude hand go a disturbin of the beloved
      Antelope in her last restin-place. Let her lie buried here beneath the
      ocean. Let the billowy main sound her requem, an chant her foon&rsquo;ral dirge.
      An now, farwell! an may you be happy! Good by, Antelope&mdash;ole friend&mdash;an
      receive, as your last legacy an benediction, the belessin of the mournful
      Corbet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ceased. Silence followed, and in that silence they all retired from the
      Antelope, and returned to the shore.

      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a few weeks yet of vacation, boys,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;and if we want
      to enjoy ourselves, we&rsquo;d better get out of this as fast as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought, at any rate, to write to our fathers and mothers,&rdquo; said Phil;
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;ll think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write!&rdquo; said Bruce; &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better hurry off home our own selves, and not
      send letters. For my part, I&rsquo;m ready to start off this evening for Grand
      Pré.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grand Pré? But why Grand Pré?&rdquo; asked Arthur. &ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said
      Bruce: &ldquo;what other way is there to go? We&rsquo;ll have to get away from this,
      of course; and it seems most natural to cross the mountain to Grand Pré,
      and then go on by stage. Bart could leave us at Windsor, and take the
      steamer for St. John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure an the stage goes the other way altogether,&rdquo; said Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, down the valley to Annapolis; an the steamer starts from that to St.
      John, so it does; an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s twice as near, so it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is. St. John is only sixty mile from Annapolis, and it&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n a
      hundred an twinty from Windsor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Annapolis is seventy or eighty miles from this place, and Windsor&rsquo;s
      only thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, it&rsquo;s easier goin by the way of Annapolis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is; you go down the valley, so you do, an the other way you have
      to go up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! nonsense! The Annapolis valley isn&rsquo;t a hill. The fact is, from here
      to St. John it&rsquo;s easier to go by the way of Windsor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s further thin&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a hundred and fifty miles by the way of Windsor,
      and only a hundred and forty-seven by the way of Annapolis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy either way. What&rsquo;s the use of
      talking about a hundred and fifty miles, when you need only go half that
      distance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half that distance? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, across the bay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Across the bay? O! Why, that completely alters the case,&rdquo; said Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, but how can we go on fut across the bay? or by stage?&rdquo; objected
      Pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There don&rsquo;t seem to be any schooner here,&rdquo; said Arthur, looking all
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the others did the same, searching narrowly the whole line of coast.
      Nothing, however, was visible of the nature of a vessel. Boats there were,
      however, in plenty, quite commodious too, but none of them sufficiently
      large to take them so far as St. John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Bart, your idea of getting to St. John by water won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo;
       said Bruce. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better make up your mind to come along with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I&rsquo;ll go, of course, along with you; we must stick together as long as
      we can; but we must settle, first of all, which is the best way to go.
      You&rsquo;ll find it most convenient to come to St. John. You can go from there
      up the bay, and then go over to Prince Edward Island, easier than by any
      other route.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know but that we can, at least as easy as any other way,
      and so I&rsquo;ve no objection; but won&rsquo;t it be best to go to Windsor, or, if
      you prefer it, to Annapolis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s find out, first of all, whether there is any chance of going
      by a more direct way. Old Bennie can tell us all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Tom, who had thus far taken no part in the discussion,
      &ldquo;let&rsquo;s ask old Bennie; he can tell us what&rsquo;s best to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words the boys walked on faster towards where old Bennie was
      sauntering about with Captain Corbet and Solomon. At the first mention of
      their wish Bennie energetically refused to say anything about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to stay here, boys&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got to, you know; an thar&rsquo;s no
      use talkin, an that&rsquo;s all about it&mdash;thar now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This the good Bennie said over and over again, persisting in it most
      obstinately. At length Bart managed to secure his attention long enough to
      convey to him an idea of the circumstances in which they were, and
      especially the regard which they had for their respective parents. At the
      mention of this Bennie&rsquo;s obstinacy gave away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, thar,&rdquo; boys, said he, &ldquo;that thar does knock me, an I give up. The
      fact is, when I regard you, and think on what you&rsquo;ve ben a doin on, an how
      you&rsquo;ve ben adoin of it, an what sort of a craft you&rsquo;ve ben a navigatin in,
      I feel as though the parients an guardins of sech as youns had ort to be
      pitied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Bennie&rsquo;s commiseration for these anxious parents was so great
      that he changed his tactics at once, and instead of trying to keep the
      boys with him, he exhibited the utmost eagerness to hasten their
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go straight off to St. John, boys, from this place, for there
      ain&rsquo;t a schooner in jest now; but there&rsquo;s a way of goin that&rsquo;ll take you
      to that place faster, mebbe, than you could go if you went direct in a
      sailin craft. It&rsquo;s to get off to the nighest place where the steamer
      touches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parrsboro&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parrsboro&rsquo;? and how far is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, only a few miles; it&rsquo;s only jest round thar;&rdquo; and Bennie swung his arm
      round over towards the right, indicating a vast extent of the earth&rsquo;s
      surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we all know Parrsboro&rsquo; perfectly well,&rdquo; said Bart; &ldquo;but when can we
      catch the steamer there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to-morrow, some time, at about half tide. The steamer comes up
      to-night, and goes down tomorrow. So, if you go to Parrsboro&rsquo; an take the
      steamer thar, you&rsquo;ll be able to be in St. John quicker than if you went
      any other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This intelligence at once settled the question completely. They all saw
      that to go by land part of the way would take up much longer time.
      Parrsboro&rsquo; was so near that it needed only to be mentioned for them all to
      adopt at once this plan. The only question now remaining was how to get
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, there ain&rsquo;t no trouble about that,&rdquo; said Bennie. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s my boat&mdash;a
      nice, clean, roomy one; and I&rsquo;ll engage to put you over in Parrsboro&rsquo;
      quick sticks. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t big enough, quite, to take you to St. John;
      not because she couldn&rsquo;t go there, for I&rsquo;d a precious sight sooner cross
      the bay&mdash;yes, or the Atlantic Ocean&mdash;in her than in that old
      Antelope; but because she hain&rsquo;t got good sleepin accommodations in case
      we was to be delayed, as would be very probable. She&rsquo;s ony an open boat&mdash;a
      beautiful one for sailin in by day, an in fine weather, but not overly
      good for long vyges for reasons above mentioned, as you&rsquo;ll observe, young
      gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can we get over there to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, let me see. The tide&rsquo;s a leetle agin us, but bein as you&rsquo;re anxious,
      I don&rsquo;t know but what we might do it. There ain&rsquo;t much wind about, an we
      may have to pull a bit; but we&rsquo;ll do what we can, an then, you know, we&rsquo;ve
      got all night afore us. Even at the wust we&rsquo;re sure to get to Parrs-boro&rsquo;
      before the steamer doos; for if the tide&rsquo;s too much for us we can wait
      till it turns, and then go up with the flood. An so, if you&rsquo;re bound to be
      off, why, here am I, in good order and condition, an at your service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bennie now led the way to his boat, which was drawn up on the beach. It
      was an open fishing boat of large size, with one mast and sail. It was, as
      Bennie had said, quite clean and comfortable, and afforded a very pleasant
      mode of dropping over to the Parrsboro&rsquo; shore. Having once seen the boat,
      the boys were now all eager to be off. Bennie, however, insisted on their
      taking their dinner before starting. This they all consented to do very
      readily. The dinner was almost ready, and Bennie prepared for the voyage,
      which preparation consisted chiefly in moving the boat down over the beach
      to the water, which was some distance away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed the dinner, which was served up in the usual sumptuous style
      peculiar to Mrs. Bennie, After this followed a kindly farewell to their
      motherly hostess, and the boys followed Bennie to the beach, accompanied
      by the venerable Corbet and the aged Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been no slight task to move the heavy boat from the place where she
      had been lying all the way down to the water, for the tide was quite low,
      and the space intervening was considerable; but Bennie had accomplished
      the task with the help of some of his neighbors, and the boat now lay so
      that a slight push might suffice to set her afloat; and inside were some
      provisions prepared by the forethought of Mrs. Bennie, together with some
      wraps put there with an eye to some sudden assault of the fog. Everything
      was, therefore, very well ordered to secure the comfort of the travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way to the boat the venerable Corbet and the aged Solomon were
      silent, and appeared overcome with emotion. This silence was first broken
      by Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell ye what, chilen,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it am drefful hard for a &rsquo;fectionate
      ole nigga like me to hab to undergo dis yer operatium. Can&rsquo;t stan it, no
      how; an donno what on erf I&rsquo;se a gwine to do. Here I ben a romin ober the
      mighty oceam, feelin like de father an garden ob all of youns; and now it
      &rsquo;mos stracts dis yer ole nigga to tar his sef away. Blest if I
      ain&rsquo;t like to break down like a chicken; an I ain&rsquo;t got nuffin else to do.
      Darsen&rsquo;t go on wid you, Mas&rsquo;r Bart&mdash;darsen&rsquo;t, no how. Braid ob dat ar
      ole woman wid de gridiron. De aged Solomon hab got to become a pilgrin an
      awander on de face ob de erf. But I ain&rsquo;t gwine to wander yet a while; I
      pose to make a bee-line for de Cad&rsquo;my. I hab a hope dat de ole &rsquo;oman
      hab not got dar; an if so I be safe, an tany rate de doctor&rsquo;ll take her in
      hand&mdash;he&rsquo;s de boy&mdash;dat ar&rsquo;s de identical gemman dat kin overhaul
      her an teach her her &lsquo;p&rsquo;s&rsquo; an &lsquo;q&rsquo;s.&rsquo; But what you&rsquo;ll do, chilen, widout me
      to cook, and to carve, an to car for you, am more dan I can magine. Ony I
      truss we&rsquo;m boun to meet agin afore long, an jine in de social band; an so
      you won&rsquo;t forgit ole Solomon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys all shook him warmly by the hand, advising him to go by all means
      back to the Academy, and put himself at once under the protection of the
      doctor, who would defend him from all possible dangers arising out of his
      &ldquo;ole &rsquo;oman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mate, Wade, also received their farewells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far the venerable Corbet had been a mute spectator; his heart was
      full; his mind seemed preoccupied; he seemed to follow mechanically. At
      last he saw the moment come which must once more sever him from them, and
      with a long breath he began to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It air seldom, young sirs,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I am called on to experience a
      sensation sich as that which this moment swells this aged boosom; an I
      feel that this is one of the most mournful moments of my checkered career.
      Thar&rsquo;s a sadness, an a depression, an a melancholy, sich as I&rsquo;ve seldom
      knowed afore. Tain&rsquo;t altogether the loss of the friend of my youth. That
      air passed and gone&mdash;&lsquo;tis o&rsquo;er. I&rsquo;ve met that grief an surmounted
      him. But it was a sore struggle, and the aged Corbet ain&rsquo;t the man he once
      was. Consequently, I&rsquo;m onmanned; I&rsquo;m all took aback. It&rsquo;s this here
      separation, boys dear, comin as it doos, hard an fast on the heels of the
      great calamity of the loved and lost Antelope. But it&rsquo;s got to be.&rdquo;&mdash;He
      paused and sighed heavily. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued, pensively, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s got to
      be. You ain&rsquo;t my sons; you&rsquo;ve got parients an gardens that&rsquo;s anxious about
      you an wants to see you, and no doubt hain&rsquo;t got that confidence in me
      which they might have in some. But go you, boys dear, and tell all them
      parients an gardens that there ain&rsquo;t a pang, an there ain&rsquo;t a emotion, an
      there ain&rsquo;t a anxiety, an there ain&rsquo;t a grief that they&rsquo;ve ever had for
      any of you that I haven&rsquo;t had for every one of you. Tell them that there
      ain&rsquo;t a tear that they&rsquo;ve shed over you, but I&rsquo;ve shed too: an there ain&rsquo;t
      a sigh they&rsquo;ve heaved what I haven&rsquo;t heaved, and ain&rsquo;t a groan they&rsquo;ve
      groaned that I ain&rsquo;t groaned too. Tell them that Corbet, with all his
      faults, loves you still, an that if you run into dangers and trials, thar
      wan&rsquo;t a moment when he wouldn&rsquo;t hev shed his heart&rsquo;s blood to get you off
      safe and clear. Don&rsquo;t let em run away with the idee that I&rsquo;m a
      stony-hearted monster that&rsquo;s ben a endangerin of your lives in divers
      places. I&rsquo;m ready to be blamed for carless-ness an ignorance, boys dear,
      but not for lack of affection. You know it, an I know that you know it, an
      what I want is for you all to make them know it too. For, boys dear, I&rsquo;m a
      father, an I know a father&rsquo;s heart, an I wouldn&rsquo;t have the heart of any
      father made bitter against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How long the venerable navigator would have gone on talking, it is
      impossible to say; indeed, it seemed now as if, after his long silence,
      his tongue, having once found voice, had become endowed with perpetual
      motion, and was ready to wag forever. But Bennie Grigg put on a stopper,
      and abruptly interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, all right, my hearty,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll engage that they&rsquo;ll do
      all that; but thar ain&rsquo;t no time to lose; so tumble in, boys, tumble in,
      and let&rsquo;s get off so as to round the pint an take the flood tide as it
      runs up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this the boys all shook hands hurriedly with Captain Corbet, one
      after another, and then each one &ldquo;tumbled&rdquo; into the boat. Captain Corbet,
      thus suddenly silenced, remained silent as he seized each one&rsquo;s hand. Then
      Bennie called upon him and Solomon to help him shove off the boat. Then
      Bennie jumped in and hoisted the sail. Then the boat moved slowly away,
      bearing the &ldquo;B. O. W. C.&rdquo; and their fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good by, boys,&rdquo; wailed Captain Corbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good by,&rdquo; murmured the aged Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good by! Good by!&rdquo; cried all the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet soon,&rdquo; said Captain Corbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes&mdash;in a few weeks,&rdquo; cried Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so with frequent good bys the boat moved slowly from the beach, and
      slowly passed over the water till the forms of the aged Solomon and the
      ancient mariner were gradually lost to view.

      triumphant.</i> <br /><br /><span class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap"
       style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE tide was coming up; some time had
      elapsed since the Antelope had sunk, and it had sufficed for the ebb of
      the tide and its return to its flood. The wind also was light, and as they
      sought to get out of Scott&rsquo;s Bay, they had the tide against them, and very
      little wind to favor them. At first they moved rather along the line of
      the shore than away from it, and though they lost sight of the figures on
      the beach, they did not therefore make any very great progress. </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Scott&rsquo;s Bay is enclosed in a circle of land formed by the Nova Scotia
      coast, which here rises high above the Bay of Fundy, and throws out a
      long, circling arm, terminating in a rugged, storm-beaten, and sea-worn
      crag, known as Cape Split. It was necessary to double this cape, and then
      go up the Strait of Minas to Parrsboro&rsquo;, which place was at the head of
      the strait, inside Minas Basin, and rig opposite Cape Blomidon. In order
      to do this, either the wind or the tide ought to favor the navigator; but,
      unfortunately, on the present occasion, they were not thus favored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had an idee,&rdquo; said Bennie, after a long silence, &ldquo;I had an idee that
      the wind would come up a leetle stronger out here, but it don&rsquo;t seem to;
      an now I&rsquo;ve a notion that it&rsquo;s goin to turn. If so we&rsquo;ll be delayed, but
      still you&rsquo;ll be landed in Parrsboro&rsquo; time enough to catch the steamer.
      Only you may have to be longer gettin thar than you counted on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we don&rsquo;t care. Only get us there in time for the steamer, and we won&rsquo;t
      complain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;s best to make up one&rsquo;s mind for the wust, you know. The wind may
      change, an then we may be out half the night, or even all night. But, at
      any rate, I&rsquo;ll put you through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think about any inconvenience to us. We&rsquo;re only too grateful
      to you for putting yourself out so much, and none of us would care whether
      we were out all night or not. We&rsquo;ve learned to rough it during the last
      two or three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bennie now diverted his gaze to the surrounding sea, and kept his eyes
      fixed upon it for a long time in silence, while the boys chatted together
      in the light-hearted manner peculiar to those who feel quite comfortable,
      and have no particular aversion even to a moderate amount of discomfort.
      Yet Bennie did not seem altogether at ease. There was a slight frown on
      his noble brow, and he did not show that genial disposition which
      generally distinguished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was light and fitful. At first it had been favorable, but before
      long it changed. It did not grow stronger, indeed; yet still, though it
      continued light, the fact that it was acting against them made their
      prospects worse, and justified Bennie&rsquo;s fears that they might be out all
      night. The distance was not great, being not more than fifteen miles or
      so; but their course was in such a direction that the opposition of wind
      and tide might delay them to a very uncomfortable extent. The spur of the
      coast line, which terminated in Cape Split, as has been said, and formed
      the bay, ran for about five miles, and this distance it was necessary to
      traverse before they could go up the Strait of Minas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, boys,&rdquo; said Bennie, at last, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d best try the oars, for a
      while at least. We may save a tide. I don&rsquo;t know, but at any rate we&rsquo;d
      best try an see; for, you see, we&rsquo;ve got the wind agin us now,&mdash;what
      thar is of it,&mdash;an thar&rsquo;s no knowin how much wuss it may grow. If we
      could ony git around, that pint afore the tide turned, we might save
      ourselves from spendin the night aboard. I did hope that the wind might
      favor us; but it&rsquo;s changed since we started, an now I see we&rsquo;d best prepar
      for the wust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; cried Bruce, cheerily: &ldquo;we&rsquo;re in for anything. We can pull as
      long as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this the boys took the oars which were in the boat, and began to row.
      There were four oars. Bennie lowered the sail, and took the stroke oar,
      Bruce and Arthur took the next oars, and Bart the bow oar. They rowed in
      this way for about an hour, and then they changed, Arthur taking the
      stroke oar, Tom and Phil the next oars, and Pat the bow oar. Bruce soon
      relieved Arthur, and thus they rowed along.
    </p>
    <p>
      The labor at the oars, far from being unpleasant, served to beguile the
      time. Those who were not rowing sang songs to enliven the labor of the
      rowers. Bennie was anxious to row all the time, but after the first hour
      he was not allowed to row any more, the boys declaring that it was enough
      for him to come with them, and that it was no more than fair that they
      should work their own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went, the wind increased somewhat, and, as the tide was strong,
      the two powers combined to oppose their progress. They therefore did not
      make the headway which was desirable, and after one hour of steady pulling
      they did not find themselves more than half way to Cape Split. Still, they
      did not become discouraged, but rowed bravely on, making the change above
      mentioned, and anticipating a turn for the better when once they had
      doubled the cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they reached the cape. More than two hours of hard rowing had
      been required to bring them there, and on reaching this place they saw
      Bennie&rsquo;s face still covered with gloom and anxiety. What that might mean,
      they did not at first know; but they soon found out. At first, however,
      they were too much taken up with their own thoughts, and the natural pride
      which they felt at having attained the aim of so long and anxious an
      endeavor, to notice particularly any expression which Bennie&rsquo;s face might
      assume. Besides, there was something in the scene before them which was
      sufficiently grand to engross all their thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the freaks of nature, so called, few are more extraordinary, and at
      the same time more impressive and sublime, than that which is afforded by
      this Cape Split. The whole northern shore of Nova Scotia, which borders on
      the Bay of Fundy, consists of a high ridge, known as the North Mountain.
      With one or two great chasms, like that at the entrance into Annapolis
      Basin, it runs along until it arrives at the Basin of Minas, where it
      terminates at the sublime promontory of Blomidon. Yet it hardly terminates
      here. Rather it may be said to turn about and seek once more to invade the
      water, which, for so many miles, it has defied; and thus turning, it
      advances for some miles into the Bay of Fundy, forming thus, by this
      encircling arm, Scott&rsquo;s Bay, and finally terminating in Cape Split. Here,
      where the tides are highest, and the rush of the waters strongest, Cape
      Split arises,&mdash;wild, rough, worn by the sea, and scarred by the
      storm,&mdash;a triple series of gigantic peaks that advance into the
      profoundest depths of the Bav of Fundy, whose waters, at every ebb and
      flow of their tremendous tides, roll, and foam, and boil, and seethe about
      the base of the torn promontory. The cliffs of Blomidon rise
      precipitously, and Blomidon itself is the centre of attraction in the
      scenery of a vast circuit of country; but Blomidon itself, to a near
      observer, shows less wildness of outline and less of picturesque grandeur,
      than that which is revealed in the terrific outline of Cape Split. Taken
      in connection with all the surrounding landscape as its centre and heart,
      Blomidon is undoubtedly superior; but taken by itself alone, without any
      adjuncts save sea and sky, it is Cape Split that the artist would choose
      to portray upon the canvas, or the lover of the picturesque and the
      sublime to feast his eyes upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, was the point which they had reached, and they saw before them
      a series of giant rocks towering aloft from the depths of the sea hundreds
      of feet into the air,&mdash;black, rough, without a trace of vegetation,
      thrusting their sharp pinnacles into the sky, while thousands of sea-gulls
      screamed about their summits, and myriads of sea-waves beat about their
      bases. There the tide rolled, and the ocean currents streamed to and fro,
      and the billows of the sea kept up perpetual war, assailing the flinty
      rock, and slowly wearing away, as they had been doing through the ages,
      atom by atom and fragment by fragment, the forms of these mighty bulwarks
      of the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the scene upon which they gazed as they reached Cape Split and
      prepared to enter into the Strait of Minas. But Bennie&rsquo;s brow was dark,
      and Bennie&rsquo;s brow was gloomy, and there were thoughts in Bennie&rsquo;s mind
      which had no connection with any grandeur of scenery or beauty of
      landscape. For Bennie was thinking of the practical, and not of the
      picturesque; and so it was that the question of reaching Parrsboro&rsquo; was of
      far more importance to him than the glories and the grandeur and all the
      sublime attractions of Cape Split.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell you what it is, boys,&rdquo; said he, after a long and thoughtful silence,
      &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve missed it, an we&rsquo;ve got to look sharp, or else we&rsquo;ll miss it agen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missed it? Missed what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Why, everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything. What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, it&rsquo;s this con-founded tide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; said Bennie, scratching his grizzled head, &ldquo;I thought we
      might git round the cape in time to catch the flood tide, and if so, it
      would carry us straight up to Parrsboro&rsquo;; but, un-fort&rsquo;nately, we&rsquo;ve jest
      missed it. We&rsquo;ve took so much time in gittin here that we&rsquo;ve lost the
      flood. The tide&rsquo;s now on the ebb, an it&rsquo;s clear agin us. What&rsquo;s wuss, it
      runs down tremenjus, an it&rsquo;ll be a leetle hard for us to git up anyhow;
      an, what&rsquo;s wusser, thar&rsquo;s goin to be a fog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a fog, an no mistake. See thar,&rdquo;&mdash;and Bennie pointed down the
      bay,&mdash;&ldquo;see thar. The wind&rsquo;s ben a shiftin an&rsquo;s finally settled into a
      son-wester, an thar&rsquo;s the fog a drawin in all round us, an before another
      half hour we&rsquo;ll be all shut in, an won&rsquo;t be able to see the other end of
      the boat. What&rsquo;s wuss still, the fog is goin to be a reglar settled fog,
      an may last a fortnight, an the ony thing that I can see in our favor jest
      now is, that the wind is fair for us; but, unfortinately, the wind don&rsquo;t
      seem to promise to be strong enough to carry us up agin the tide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Can&rsquo;t we get to Parrsboro&rsquo; in time for the steamer at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The steamer? O, yes, no doubt about that. But what I&rsquo;m afeard on is, that
      we&rsquo;ll be all night about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, well, that can&rsquo;t be helped. We can stand it. We&rsquo;ve had worse things
      than this to stand of late, and this is mere child&rsquo;s play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child&rsquo;s play? Wal, I don&rsquo;t know about that altogether,&rdquo; said Bennie. &ldquo;For
      my part, I don&rsquo;t seem to see how goin&rsquo; without sleep&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s play, as
      you call it; but still I&rsquo;m glad all the same that you look on it in this
      way; I am railly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, you needn&rsquo;t give any thought to us. We&rsquo;re old stagers. We&rsquo;ve been
      shipwrecked and we&rsquo;ve lived on desert islands. We&rsquo;ve risked our lives a
      dozen times in a dozen days. Fellows that have been cast ashore on
      Anticosti and on Sable Island, can&rsquo;t be frightened at anything that you
      can mention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After my life on Ile Haute out there,&rdquo; said Tom, looking at the dim form
      of Ile Haute, which was even then being enveloped in the gathering fog, &ldquo;I
      think this is mere child&rsquo;s play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after my adventures in the woods,&rdquo; said Phil, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready for
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pat and I,&rdquo; said Bart, &ldquo;have known all the bitterness of death, and have
      felt what it is to be buried alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An meself,&rdquo; said Pat, &ldquo;by the same token, have known what it is to bathe
      in the leper wather, so I have; an what&rsquo;s fog to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my turn off Anticosti in the boat, Tom and
      I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;have had my turn at the Five Islands; so you see
      you&rsquo;ve got to do with a lot of fellows that don&rsquo;t care a rush for fogs and
      tides, and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, young fellers,&rdquo; said Bennie, &ldquo;I knock under, I cave in. I won&rsquo;t say
      anything more. You&rsquo;re all the right sort, an are ready for anything. So
      come along; an here goes for Parrsboro&rsquo;. You&rsquo;ve got to be up all night;
      but arter all, you&rsquo;ve got wraps and rugs, an bread an butter, an pie, an
      can keep yourselves warm, an can have enough to eat,&mdash;so what&rsquo;s the
      odds, as long as you&rsquo;re happy? I ain&rsquo;t a croaker, I ain&rsquo;t, but go in for
      bein cheerful, an if you ain&rsquo;t goin to knock under, why I ain&rsquo;t, an so
      let&rsquo;s be jolly an move on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, Bennie hoisted his sail once more. The wind was light, but
      fair, and the only question now was, whether that wind would be strong
      enough to carry the boat against the tide. As to the tide, that was
      certainly sufficiently strong, but unfortunately it was unfavorable. The
      tide had turned, and was running down the Strait of Minas, up which they
      wished to go. The tide was thus adverse, and in addition to this was the
      fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fog!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the fog, the dreaded, the baleful fog, was coming on. Already Ile
      Haute was concealed from view. Soon the opposite shore would be veiled.
      Worse than all, the night was coming on. With fog and darkness united,
      their way would be uncertain indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for them, the way was a straight one, and the wind, though not
      very strong, and though opposed by the tide, was yet fair. This much was
      in their favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they spread their sails. And the wind filled the sails, and the
      boat went on. The tide was against them, but still the boat advanced. Some
      progress, at last, was made. Hour after hour passed, and still they went
      on. Bennie seemed to be quite encouraged. At last they came to a wide
      beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; said Bennie, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re here at last. This is the place, lads. We&rsquo;re
      at Parrsboro&rsquo;! Hurrah!&rdquo;

      class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T had been a most
      eventful day for all the boys, and when they stepped ashore it was nine
      o&rsquo;clock in the evening. They looked around with some curiosity, for they
      saw no signs of houses just here, though the fog had diminished greatly,
      and it was not so dark but that they could see the outline of the shore.
      </span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; said Bennie, &ldquo;here you are. You see that island in front,&mdash;well,
      Parrsboro&rsquo; is just behind that, and not more&rsquo;n half a mile off by land.
      It&rsquo;s too far to go round it in the boat; so we&rsquo;ll leave her here, and I&rsquo;ll
      show you the way along the shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Bennie drew up the boat a little distance, and secured
      it by putting the anchor out upon the beach. After this he started off,
      and the boys followed. Bennie walked along the beach, occasionally
      explaining the different objects around, pointing out Blomidon, Partridge
      Island, and other places, all familiar enough, and needing only to be
      mentioned to be recognized by the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they came in sight of a number of houses on the side of a hill
      close by a cove. Lights shone in the windows, and everything had a most
      inviting appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you air, boys,&rdquo; said Bennie, &ldquo;an here I&rsquo;ll leave you, for you can
      find your way on easy enough. You&rsquo;ve only got to foller your noses. I&rsquo;ve
      got to go back an drop down with the tide so as to git to Cape Split
      before the wind goes down. An so I&rsquo;ll bid you good by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boys made no effort to detain him, for they knew well that the return
      would be tedious, and had no desire to keep him away from his home any
      longer than they could help. So they all shook hands with him, thanking
      him earnestly, and promising, in obedience to his reiterated request, to
      pay him a visit on their return to school. Bennie now left them and
      returned to his boat, in which he embarked and set sail for Scott&rsquo;s Bay.
      The boys went on. The village was reached in a short time, and they walked
      to the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering the parlor of the inn, they were accosted by the landlord, and
      the following conversation took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you give us accommodation for the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And get us some tea as quick as you can, for we&rsquo;re starving?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can have it in half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We&rsquo;ve just come over from Scott&rsquo;s Bay, and have had no end
      of a tug. We want to take the steamer here to St. John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ye&rsquo;ll be wantin to wait for the steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s the only thing for us to do; and I&rsquo;m precious glad we&rsquo;ve got
      such good quarters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ay. Parrsboro&rsquo;s a good place to stop at. There be people that stops
      here weeks an months, an says as how it&rsquo;s one of the best places goin. I
      can put yes on the way to the best streams for salmon an trout in the
      country; an ye can have a nice boat if ye want to go over to Blomidon;
      it&rsquo;s a mighty fine place over there, and folks finds cur&rsquo;ous minerals; an
      if ye want deep-sea fishin, why, out there a mile or two in the bay ye can
      get no end of cod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, for that matter, we haven&rsquo;t any idea of sporting. We&rsquo;re in too much of
      a hurry. Just get us a tea and bed, and I suppose we&rsquo;ll have time to get
      breakfast to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The landlord stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time? Breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; before the steamer comes, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before the steamer comes?&rdquo; repeated the landlord, dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I suppose she won&rsquo;t touch here too early but that we&rsquo;ll have time
      for breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast? When? To-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s no steamer comes to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that astonishing intelligence, all the boys started up to their feet
      from the easy lounging attitudes into which they had flung themselves, and
      surrounding the landlord, stared at him with speechless amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Bruce, at last; &ldquo;no steamer to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; O, dear, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;when does she come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she was here this morning, and won&rsquo;t be here again till this day
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she was here about ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning! Ten o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the boys subsided into silence. All was plain now. Bennie had
      utterly mistaken the day of the steamer. It was not an unlikely thing for
      him to do, living as he did in an out-of-the-way place, and having no
      interest in the steamer&rsquo;s movements. But the mistake had been made, and
      there was the stolid fact that no steamer would touch at Parrsboro&rsquo; for a
      whole week to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord now went off to prepare their tea, and the boys, left to
      themselves, discussed the situation in a low, melancholy, and utterly
      dispirited way. At length tea made its appearance&mdash;a bounteous
      repast. The well-loaded table gave a new turn to their thoughts, and as
      they sat down with ravenous appetites to partake of the same, they felt
      that they had something still left to live for.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea they resumed the discussion of the situation. It seemed to them
      now not by any means so forlorn and gloomy as it had done before tea, for
      then they were weary, worn out, and half starved; but now, thanks to the
      generous repast, they all felt life, and strength, and hope, and looked
      out upon life and its vicissitudes with the utmost equanimity. So great is
      the effect which is produced upon the mind by a good dinner! They now
      invited the landlord to take a share in their discussion, and in order to
      enable him to do so to the best advantage, they enlightened him as to the
      immediate cause of their presence here, informing him about the voyage of
      the Antelope, her mournful fate, and Bennie Grigg&rsquo;s kindness in bringing
      them to Parrs-boro&rsquo;. Bennie had indeed been very kind, and had put himself
      to no end of trouble for their sakes, and was even at that time, perhaps,
      thinking, with a glow of satisfaction, of them, little dreaming how
      completely, though unintentionally, he had deceived them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing the landlord advised, after hearing all this, was, that
      they had better wait till the steamer came. He offered, if they did so, to
      put them in the way of all the sport that the country could afford,&mdash;fishing
      of all kinds, shooting too, and excursions to places of interest. But the
      landlord&rsquo;s offer was not very gratefully received. It was, in fact,
      rejected at once most peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wait a week! And in Parrsboro&rsquo;! Impossible! It was not to be thought of
      for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      What else was there to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      To this question the landlord showed two answers. One thing to do was to
      go by land; another thing, to try to find some schooner, and go by water.
      As to the land route he had much to say. There was a mail stage that ran
      every week to New Brunswick, but as it went only on steamboat days, and as
      it would not go for another week, they found no help here. The landlord,
      however, pointed out to them the fact that they could hire a wagon and
      travel in that way. He offered to furnish them with a commodious wagon,
      and a very nice pair of ponies that would take them through to Dorchester,
      in New Brunswick, where they could catch the steamer for St. John, or go
      in the mail stage. But, unfortunately, on reckoning up the time and
      distance, they found that it would take about four days to perform their
      journey in this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The water route still remained. Could they not find a schooner that was
      about leaving? The landlord rather thought they could. One way would be to
      wait till some schooner passed by on its way down the bay, and board her.
      He felt certain that any coaster would land them at St. John. Another way
      would be to go to Mill Village,&mdash;a part of Parrsboro&rsquo;, which lay
      about a mile off, behind a hill,&mdash;and look up a vessel among the
      numerous ones which at that time happened to be in port. Both of these
      suggestions seemed good, and the boys felt sanguine that something might
      result. They therefore dismissed the idea of going by land, and resolved
      to wait at least one day, to see whether they might not find some schooner
      which would take them down the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very late when this discussion was finished, and the boys, whom
      excitement had thus far sufficed to keep awake, now yielded to the
      combined influence of fatigue and sleepiness, and retired for the night.
      That night passed in profound slumber, and the dawn of day still found
      them in deep sleep. It was after ten o&rsquo;clock before any one of them awoke;
      and even then, so sleepy were they that they did not feel inclined to get
      up. But they had work before them, and so they managed to dress themselves
      and put in an appearance at breakfast, which had been waiting for them for
      two or three hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a journey to Mill Village. It was a beautiful day; all the
      fog was gone; there was not a cloud in the sky; the water was rippled by a
      gentle breeze from the north, and its blue surface seemed more inviting
      than ever. It seemed to promise them a pleasant return to their home if
      they would only trust themselves once more to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord had a wagon all ready for them, and a short drive brought
      them to Mill Village. It was rather larger and busier than the little
      settlement where the inn was, and they noticed with delight three
      schooners in port. On reaching the place they hurried about, making
      inquiries. But the result of the inquiries was not very cheering. The
      first schooner which they visited was about leaving for Windsor, to take
      in a load of plaster, which would occupy a week, after which she would
      sail for Boston. Schooner the second would not leave for a fortnight, for
      she was waiting for a cargo of deals. Schooner the third was even worse.
      She was not seaworthy, and the skipper was hesitating between repairing
      her and condemning her. On making inquiries further as to the probability
      of other vessels being available along the coast, they could learn
      nothing. And this was the result of their journey, and with this they had
      to satisfy themselves as best they might. There was nothing now left but
      to return to the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one o&rsquo;clock when they reached the inn. They were all disheartened,
      and did not know exactly what to do. Dinner over, they began once more to
      discuss the situation; and the more they discussed it the more they found
      it necessary to hire the landlord&rsquo;s team and set out to make the long,
      roundabout land journey. But it was now too late to set out on this day,
      and it would be necessary to wait till the morrow. This, then, was the
      conclusion to which they came; and having reached it, they began to feel
      more settled in their minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about three o&rsquo;clock when this question was at last settled, and
      weary with their long discussion, they all went out to stroll about the
      village and along the beach. The village was not much to speak of. Some
      half dozen houses, with their attendant barns, comprised it all. The
      beach, however, was very much indeed. To the right, Partridge Island
      arose, lofty, rugged, wooded, projecting into the Strait of Minas.
      Opposite was a long line of precipitous cliff, which terminated in
      Blomidon. The beach began at Partridge Island, and ran on in a long,
      curving line for more than two miles, covered with pebbles, and sloping
      gradually to the water. The view was remarkably beautiful. On the right,
      the rugged, wooded island; in front, the long line of cliff on the
      opposite side of the strait; farther in, the sublime form of Blomidon; on
      the left, the beach, winding far away till it terminated in a promontory,
      beyond which spread the wide waters of the Basin of Minas, terminated in
      the dim distance by the far-off line of coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there, as they strolled along the beach, they became aware of an
      object on that wide sheet of water which filled them all with the most
      intense interest. A sail!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; there was a sail there, and it was moving towards them&mdash;to wards
      the Strait of Minas. Doubtless it was some vessel on its way down the bay.
      It was a schooner bound, perhaps, for Boston&mdash;or perhaps for St.
      John. What mattered it? Enough that it was going down the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      One wild shout of joy burst forth from all that forlorn party as they
      recognized the truth. Here came deliverance; here came a way of escape;
      they were saved. Other times they had known when the sight of an
      approaching vessel would have been the assurance of escape from something
      worse than this, of course; but their situation now, though not perilous,
      was monotonous, and wearisome, and doleful, and altogether miserable; and
      so they naturally hailed this new appearance with shouts of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how to get to her was now the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      How? Easily enough. Had not the landlord already suggested a way? Had he
      not promised to furnish them with a boat, with which they might board any
      passing vessel? Boats there were, in plenty, along the shore, and any one
      of these would suffice for their purpose. There was no time to lose. The
      schooner was coming quickly on, borne by wind and tide; they must make
      haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they did make haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurrying back to the inn, they acquainted the landlord with the new state
      of affairs. That worthy, though loath to lose his lodgers, was still
      honest and sympathetic enough to use all energy towards furthering their
      desires, and proposed at once to take to the boat. As for the boys, they
      all felt perfectly sure that this schooner would take them; and so they
      insisted on paying their bills and taking a final leave of the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat was launched without any trouble, and soon was passing over the
      waters, impelled by oars in the hands of Bruce, Arthur, Bart, and Tom. The
      schooner came on, nearer and nearer, and finally came within hail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Schooner, ahoy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boat, ahoy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you bound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Schooner Dart&mdash;St. John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. We want to go aboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments the boat was alongside, and the boys were all aboard.
      They waved a farewell to the landlord, who dropped astern, and then turned
      to the skipper to make known their wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first look which they gave to the skipper, who was standing there
      before them, was enough to fill them with surprise and delight. In that
      broad, thick-set frame, and that honest, jovial face, they recognized an
      old friend and a cherished one&mdash;one, too, who was associated with the
      memories of former adventures; in fact, no other than Captain Pratt. At so
      strange and unexpected a meeting they were all filled with amazement. One
      cry burst from them all,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Pratt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The worthy Pratt, on his part, was no less surprised, and, it must be
      added, no less delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, boys, where in the world have you sprung from? Have you been a
      cruisin about Minas Basin ever since? It looks like it; but railly now&mdash;it
      can&rsquo;t be&mdash;it can&rsquo;t railly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo; said Bart, who then and there began to give a brief
      outline of the adventures of the &ldquo;B. O. W. C.&rdquo; since the time of their
      visit to Pratt&rsquo;s Cove, where they had last parted with their worthy
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was there a pleasanter meeting. It was altogether unexpected, yet
      not unnatural, for Captain Pratt was a frequent cruiser over these waters,
      and was now, as he informed them, on his way to St. John with a cargo of
      deals. The jovial captain made them tell the whole story of all their
      adventures since they had last parted with him, in the Bay of Fundy, in
      the country about the Bay de Chaleur, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, at
      Anticosti, Sable Island, and Mahone Bay, and thus acquainted himself with
      every particular of the wonderful story which they had to tell. The worthy
      captain regarded it all as a joke, and at every fresh incident his homeric
      laughter burst forth in long, irrepressible peals.
    </p>
    <p>
      But such a story occupied some time in the narration, and before it was
      ended the schooner was far out of the Strait of Minas, beyond Ile Haute,
      in the Bay of Fundy. On one side lay the Nova Scotia shore, on the other
      the coast of New Brunswick. Before them extended the waters of the bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night came, and they all slept. On the following day, in the afternoon,
      they reached St. John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their adventures for a time were over. Bart took all his friends to his
      own home, where they spent two or three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they separated, Phil going to Nova Scotia, and Bruce, Arthur, and Tom
      to Prince Edward Island. Pat remained with Bart for the rest of the
      holidays.
    </p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
